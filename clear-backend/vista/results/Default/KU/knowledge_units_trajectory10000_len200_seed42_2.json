It assumes the vessel maintains a steady, predictable path between the known start and end points, computing intermediate latitude and longitude values at each time interval by proportionally advancing along the geodesic segment from `start` to `end`. The model leverages the strong evidence of straight-line navigation and uniform motion, making linear interpolation both accurate and interpretable."
