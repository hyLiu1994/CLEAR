Unlike linear interpolation (vf_-290947450079829879), which assumes straight-line motion and would introduce significant positional drift due to unmodeled curvature, and unlike the course-adjusted numerical integration (vf_5301664154767507996), which uses an oversimplified COG ramp (25°→30°) inconsistent with the actual trend (~22°→33°), the Slerp-based approach accurately captures both the geometric curvature and temporal dynamics.
