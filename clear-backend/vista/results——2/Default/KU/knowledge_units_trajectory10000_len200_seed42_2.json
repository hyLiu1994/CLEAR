      "describe_of_function": "This function performs linear interpolation between the start and end points of a missing trajectory segment, using the cumulative time intervals to estimate intermediate positions. It assumes a straight-line path between the known points, which is appropriate for short gaps in a vessel's trajectory where the overall motion pattern suggests minimal deviation from a direct route. The function uses the total elapsed time (Time_interval[-1]) to scale each time step proportionally along the geodesic path, ensuring consistent temporal spacing across the reconstructed segment."
