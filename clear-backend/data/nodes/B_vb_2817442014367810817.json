  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation: lat(t) ≈ 53.8466 + 0.0030 × t + 0.0002 × t², lon(t) ≈ 8.9510 + 0.0345 × t + 0.0005 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed around 11.8–12.0 knots for the initial segment, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases slowly from 78.7° to 80.1°, then decreases gradually to 74.1°, suggesting a smooth turn or channel-following behavior)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading varies slightly between 74° and 83°, remaining closely aligned with COG, indicating controlled steering without oscillation)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation: lat(t) ≈ 53.8466 + 0.0030 × t + 0.0002 × t², lon(t) ≈ 8.9510 + 0.0345 × t + 0.0005 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
