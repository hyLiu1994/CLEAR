    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 15.2 and 15.8 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG decreases slowly and monotonically from 90.1° to 21.7°, indicating a smooth, continuous turn to the right over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 19°–91°, with minimal short-term variation, suggesting controlled steering)",
