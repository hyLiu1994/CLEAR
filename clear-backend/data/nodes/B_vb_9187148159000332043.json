    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a speed of 0.0 knots across all observations, indicating it is stationary or drifting in place)",
    "Course change: stable (COG remains constant at approximately 111.6°, showing no meaningful change in direction despite minor position fluctuations)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading fluctuates slightly between 59.0° and 60.0°, remaining nearly constant, suggesting the vessel is not executing any significant rotational maneuver)",

    "Duration: 400~450"
