    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 6.0 and 7.2 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly and monotonically from approximately 270° to 200°, indicating a sustained turn over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains closely aligned with COG, fluctuating within ±3°, suggesting controlled steering without erratic behavior)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation:",
