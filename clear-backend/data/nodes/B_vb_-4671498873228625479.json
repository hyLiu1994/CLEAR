  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 6.3 and 6.8 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases slowly from 35.3° to 51.3°, then decreases slightly to 46.7°, indicating a smooth evolution in direction over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading varies within a narrow range of 5°–52°, with minimal oscillation around COG, suggesting controlled steering)",
