    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with draughts in the [8, 10) m range and dimensions typical of medium-sized freighters (100–150 m length, 20–25 m width) most frequently exhibit straight-line navigation behavior when transiting open coastal waters near Denmark, as seen in 102 out of 102 documented cases linked to this vessel profile—representing 100% co-occurrence for this pattern under identical static conditions. The high edge weights from navigation_status (w=102), vessel_type (w=73), and draught (w=39) indicate strong statistical prevalence, significantly outweighing alternative curved-route patterns despite their presence in the subgraph. Although spatial context data was unavailable due to a query failure, the dominance of this movement node among functionally similar vessels supports its selection as the most typical behavior.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a vessel maintaining a stable speed (~11.1 knots), consistent COG (215.1°–216.3°), and fixed heading (213.0°), all aligned with a linear west-southwest trajectory—indicative of steady-state navigation along a fixed route. Among the candidates, vb_-4927443205807001530 best matches this intent, describing a \"navigating along a fixed route\" behavior with stable speed, minimal heading fluctuation, and gradual course consistency, following a linear northeast path. While the absolute direction differs, the kinematic stability (stable speed, aligned COG/heading, no oscillations) and lack of significant curvature align more closely with this candidate than with the curvilinear intents of the other options. Additionally, its duration (200~250) fits within the expected range bridging the gap, and the parametric linearity mirrors the mathematical structure of the boundary segment.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that vf_-7663396197665720575 is the correct function to impute missing latitude and longitude for this behavior pattern is approximately 98.04%. This is derived from the relative weight distribution between the two candidate functions connected to the observed behavior pattern (vb_-4927443205807001530). The total weight sum is 100 + 2 = 102. The proportion of support for vf_-7663396197665720575 is therefore 100 / 102 ≈ 0.9804, or 98.04%. This indicates a strong statistical association between this function and the identified motion pattern based on historical reliability in similar contexts.  \n\n2. The function vf_-7663396197665720575 implements linear interpolation using time-proportional scaling with max(Time_interval) as the normalizing factor, ensuring smooth and temporally consistent position estimation. It explicitly accounts for stable speed, consistent COG, and minimal heading fluctuation—characteristics directly observed in the vessel’s trajectory. Its formulation aligns precisely with the parametric linear model described in the intent (lat(t) ≈ 56.114153 + 0.00087×t, lon(t) ≈ 7.607993 + 0.00034×t), where position evolves linearly over normalized time. In contrast, vf_5240413252068673064, while functionally similar, uses Time_interval[-1] instead of max(Time_interval), which may introduce inconsistencies if the time array is not monotonically increasing or normalized—a subtle but critical distinction under edge cases. Given the high stability of motion and expectation of uniform progression, the robustness and clarity of implementation in vf_-7663396197665720575 make it better matched to the current context."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Route Adherence in Designated Waterways – Applicable to cargo vessels navigating coastal waters near Denmark; Undetermined due to missing shipping lane data\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a stable speed, consistent course, and minimal heading variation—aligns with standard operating procedures for medium-sized cargo vessels transiting open coastal areas under autopilot. In such contexts, mariners typically follow predefined straight routes to ensure predictable navigation and collision avoidance, especially when environmental conditions are stable and no maneuvers are required. This pattern is highly typical given the vessel’s size, propulsion status, and lack of hazardous cargo, which reduce the need for speed or course adjustments. Although curved-route behaviors exist in the dataset, they are statistically less associated with this vessel profile under identical static conditions. The observed linear trajectory, supported by parametric modeling and high-confidence imputation using time-proportional interpolation, further confirms that the vessel was following a fixed route rather than executing a turn or responding to dynamic traffic. Therefore, steady-state motion along a straight path represents the most operationally sound interpretation.\n'''",
