  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 17.4 and 17.6 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 346.5° and 349.5°, showing a slow, steady adjustment in direction)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 346.0° to 347.0°, indicating controlled steering)",
