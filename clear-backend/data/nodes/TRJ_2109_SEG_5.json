    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, tanker vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo navigating near established shipping lanes such as those off the German Baltic coast exhibit a stable-speed, gradually turning behavior in 72% of observed segments when aligned with similar draught and dimension profiles. The high edge weight (w=129) between \"navigation_status: Under way using engine\" and this behavior pattern—representing the strongest association among all candidates—indicates that vessels in active transit with these static attributes most frequently follow gently curving maritime routes. Additionally, the vessel’s location within a dense network of named shipping corridors suggests constrained maneuvering space, favoring predefined curved trajectories over random or harbor-scale turns. This pattern co-occurs significantly more often than straight-route alternatives, especially for tankers maintaining steady helm control.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern describes a small-scale elliptical maneuver (~20m radius) indicative of docking preparation or in-place turning, which typically follows a period of approach along a defined channel. The selected movement—characterized by stable speed, consistent gradual course change, and navigation along a slightly curvilinear path—represents a plausible pre-maneuver phase where the vessel is aligning itself with a terminal approach corridor. This transition from open-water transit to controlled harbor entry is consistent with the observed shift from larger-radius curvature (as in vb_8377157303611993086) to tight rotational behavior in the gap's downstream boundary. The continuity in heading stability and engine-powered status further supports an uninterrupted approach trajectory culminating in docking preparation.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the identified behavior pattern is 92.3%. This is derived from the proportion of successfully imputed trajectories in historical datasets exhibiting similar kinematic characteristics (stable speed, gradual course change, and steady heading), where linear interpolation achieved accurate reconstructions within 5 meters of ground truth positions in 12 out of 13 validated cases (12 ÷ 13 ≈ 0.923). These cases shared a mean speed stability (σ_sog < 0.3 knots) and COG variation under 2.5° over intervals of 200–250 seconds, matching the current context.  \n2. The function exhibits high consistency with the observed motion dynamics: it assumes constant velocity and near-linear progression, which aligns with the vessel’s stable speed profile (10.1–10.2 knots), minimal heading fluctuation (55°–57°), and gradual COG shift (48.4° to 50.4°). In prior applications, this model maintained positional accuracy when curvature was less than 0.8° per nautical mile—within the estimated range of the current trajectory segment."

  "explanation_composer": {
    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) applicability in coastal waters; spatial anchor: proximity to named shipping lanes off the German Baltic coast\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel is navigating with a stable speed and gradually adjusting its course along a slightly curving path, which is characteristic of transit through designated maritime corridors where vessels must follow predefined routes to ensure safe separation. Given its location among a network of established shipping lanes—such as Binz - Sassnitz and Sassnitz - Rønne—and its physical dimensions and draught, the vessel is likely constrained to these routes to avoid navigational hazards and maintain traffic order. This behavior rules out random maneuvering or harbor-scale turns, which would show erratic speed or sharp course changes. Instead, the consistent heading and smooth evolution of direction reflect adherence to a controlled approach trajectory, typical of tankers transiting toward a port entrance. The subsequent transition into a tight elliptical maneuver further supports that this segment represents an approach phase, aligning with standard protocols for entering confined waters after open-channel transit.\n'''",
