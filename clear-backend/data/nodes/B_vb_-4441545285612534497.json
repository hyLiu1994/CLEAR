    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 15.3 and 15.9 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 215.1° and 216.8°, showing a smooth progression with minimal oscillation)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains fixed at 215.0° or 216.0°, indicating precise directional control with negligible deviation)",
