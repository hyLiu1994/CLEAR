    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' navigating within unnamed traffic separation schemes exhibit the \"navigating along a fixed route\" behavior in approximately 71% of observed segments (102 out of 143 total weighted connections for this pattern), making it the most statistically prevalent intent among vessels with matching static attributes. The vessel’s length [100, 150) m and width [20, 25) m further reinforce this pattern's dominance, as they align closely with standard cargo vessel dimensions in structured waterways. Additionally, the high edge weights from navigation status and hazardous cargo (both w=102) indicate strong behavioral consistency across similar operational conditions, suggesting that straight-line transit is the dominant movement mode for such vessels in regulated maritime corridors.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable speed (~14.5–14.9 knots), consistent COG (192.7°–194.2°), and fixed heading (191.0°), indicating steady progression along a linear trajectory toward the south-southeast. Among the candidate patterns, only vb_-4927443205807001530 matches this intent of \"navigating along a fixed route\" with stable speed, gradual course consistency, and linear parametric modeling—albeit in a northeast direction. While the absolute heading differs due to local route orientation, the kinematic signature (stable speed, minimal heading fluctuation, aligned COG-heading) and structural context (traffic separation scheme) are fully consistent. The other candidates describe curved-route navigation, which would imply increasing curvature or turning trends not supported by the boundary data’s linearity and heading stability.\n'''"

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) - Applicable to cargo vessels navigating in structured waterways; spatial anchor confirmed by proximity to an unnamed traffic separation scheme\nOperational Protocol Rationale: In regulated maritime corridors such as traffic separation schemes, vessels are expected to follow designated straight routes to maintain safe separation and predictable movement patterns. The observed behavior—stable speed, minimal heading variation, and consistent course over ground—aligns with standard operating procedures for cargo vessels transiting these zones under autopilot or bridge-controlled navigation. This pattern prioritizes route fidelity and collision avoidance, which is characteristic of disciplined passage through high-traffic or constrained waterways. Alternative behaviors involving curved trajectories or frequent course adjustments are inconsistent with the linear progression and heading stability seen here, and are typically associated with coastal maneuvering outside formal routing systems.\n'''",
