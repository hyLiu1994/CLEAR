    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and operating near major shipping lanes such as the Thor Offshore Substation exhibit the \"navigating along a fixed route\" behavior in approximately 72% of observed segments when all static attributes are considered. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels of length [100, 150) m and draught [8, 10) m, which collectively activate this behavioral node with high edge weight support (total incoming weight = 357). Specifically, navigation status and vessel type contribute the most, with combined edge weights accounting for over 60% of the total support for this movement pattern—indicating that powered cargo ships on open-water routes consistently follow linear trajectories under stable conditions.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable speed (~15.2–15.3 knots), minimal course deviation (COG: 196.3°–197.7°), and tight heading control (196°–197° ±0.5°), all indicative of straight-line navigation along a predefined maritime corridor. Among the candidate movements, only vb_-4927443205807001530 matches this intent of \"navigating along a fixed route\" with a linear parametric trajectory model. While other candidates describe curved-route following, this one uniquely reflects consistent alignment between COG and heading, stable speed, and negligible course change—directly continuing the west-southwest linear trend observed before and after the gap.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the behavior pattern is 98.04%. This is derived from the relative weight distribution between the two candidate functions associated with the observed behavior pattern. Specifically, the total weight sum for all functions linked to the pattern \"navigating along a fixed route\" is 100 + 2 = 102. The share of support for vf_-7663396197665720575 is 100 / 102 ≈ 0.9804, or 98.04%. This high proportion indicates strong empirical alignment between this function and the kinematic context of stable motion along a linear trajectory.  \n2. This function exhibits precise modeling of constant-velocity motion by scaling position increments proportionally to time within the interval. Its implementation assumes a straight-line path based on temporal progression, which matches the observed vessel behavior: stable speed, consistent COG, minimal heading fluctuation, and intent to follow a predefined route. In contrast, the alternative function (vf_5240413252068673064) uses an equivalent mathematical approach but lacks explicit directional orientation in its description (e.g., no mention of south-southwesterly motion), reducing contextual specificity despite functional similarity."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "SOLAS Chapter V, Regulation 19 — Mandatory use of routeing systems; applicable to cargo vessels navigating near offshore installations in designated shipping lanes; spatial anchor: Thor Offshore Substation\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel is operating under standard maritime navigation protocols for powered cargo ships in open waters, where stable speed, minimal course deviation, and tight alignment between heading and course over ground indicate autopilot-assisted travel along a predefined linear route. This behavior is typical in regulated shipping corridors near critical infrastructure such as offshore substations, where traffic separation schemes require predictable, straight-line trajectories to ensure collision avoidance and navigational safety. The consistent motion vector and lack of significant turns or speed changes rule out maneuvering, docking, or curvilinear channel navigation, which would exhibit greater heading fluctuations and variable speeds. Instead, the observed pattern reflects adherence to a fixed route within a structured maritime corridor, consistent with international routing conventions and regional traffic management practices.\n'''",
