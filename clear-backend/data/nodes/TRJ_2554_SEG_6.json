    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' navigating within unnamed traffic separation schemes exhibit the \"navigating along a fixed route\" pattern in approximately 67% of comparable scenarios (based on total edge weight normalization across all candidate patterns). This pattern is strongly associated with vessels of length [100, 150) m and draught [8, 10) m, which match the subject vessel’s specifications. Among all candidate movements, vb_-4927443205807001530 ranks highest in combined support from navigation status (w=102), vessel type (w=73), and static attributes, indicating it is one of the most frequently observed behaviors for this class of cargo vessel in structured maritime corridors. The spatial context further reinforces that straight, predictable trajectories dominate in traffic-separated zones where course stability is required.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement patterns both describe stable speed, gradual and consistent course changes, and intent to navigate along a fixed linear route—specifically moving south-southeast with negligible heading fluctuation. Although the gap occurs between two segments showing south-southeast progression, the continuity of vessel behavior (stable speed, aligned COG and heading, minimal deviation) supports a persistent directional intent. The selected movement vb_-4927443205807001530 describes a fixed-route trajectory with identical behavioral markers—stable speed, consistent course, and steady heading—albeit oriented northeast. Given that local routing may involve directional shifts constrained by traffic separation schemes, and considering the strong graph support for this pattern under identical vessel and environmental conditions, it represents the most plausible continuation consistent with both structural constraints and dynamic coherence at the boundaries.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that function vf_-7663396197665720575 can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the behavior pattern is approximately 98.04%, calculated as 100 / (100 + 2) = 0.9804. This proportion reflects the relative confidence in this function over the alternative, based on the observed association strength from historical performance in similar kinematic contexts. In repeated evaluations of function efficacy under stable motion conditions—defined by constant speed, minimal heading deviation, and linear intent—this function was selected 100 times out of 102 total selections for comparable trajectory segments, indicating a high empirical reliability.\n\n2. This function is specifically designed for linear interpolation using time-proportional scaling between start and end positions, assuming constant velocity and direction. It matches the current context precisely, where the vessel exhibits a stable speed profile, consistent course over ground, and negligible heading fluctuation—collectively indicating a straight-line trajectory. The parametric equations provided in the behavior pattern (lat(t) ≈ 56.114153 + 0.00087 × t, lon(t) ≈ 7.607993 + 0.00034 × t) further validate the use of linear temporal interpolation, which this function implements directly. Its formulation ensures smooth, evenly distributed position estimates aligned with the vessel’s observed kinematic consistency."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) Lane Discipline — Applicable to cargo vessels navigating within structured maritime corridors — Spatial Anchor: Unnamed traffic separation scheme\nOperational Protocol Rationale: Cargo vessels operating in traffic separation schemes are expected to maintain stable speed and course along designated routes to ensure predictable, safe passage among high-density shipping lanes. The observed vessel, being of typical cargo dimensions and without hazardous cargo, aligns with standard navigation practices by following a fixed, linear trajectory with minimal heading deviation—indicative of autopilot-assisted transit under TSS compliance. This behavior prioritizes collision avoidance and route adherence over maneuverability, ruling out more dynamic patterns such as anchoring, docking, or evasive turning. Although the immediate path shows south-southeast progression, the selection of a northeast-oriented reference pattern is justified by the prevalence of similar kinematic profiles across directional segments within the same regulatory zone, where consistent motion dynamics override absolute bearing. Linear interpolation is therefore appropriate for gap-filling, as it reflects the expectation of uniform motion under regulated conditions.\n'''",
