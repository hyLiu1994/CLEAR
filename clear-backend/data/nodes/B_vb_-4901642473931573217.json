    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 15.4–15.5 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 90.3° and 91.7°, showing a smooth, persistent eastward orientation with minor adjustments)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains fixed at 90.0° or changes only slightly to 91.0°, indicating minimal yawing or steering corrections)",
