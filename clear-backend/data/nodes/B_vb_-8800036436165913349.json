  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed around 3.0–3.2 knots during movement, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases slowly from 286.1° to 287.0°, then shifts more significantly to 268.6° before stabilizing near 295.5°, reflecting a controlled turn followed by stabilization)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 280.0°–286.0°, with minimal variation, suggesting precise rudder control)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
