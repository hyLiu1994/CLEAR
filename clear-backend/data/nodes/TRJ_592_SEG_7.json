    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and typical dimensions (100–150 m length, 20–25 m width) navigating in coastal waters of Sweden—particularly near established shipping lanes such as København–Oslo—frequently exhibit straight-line transit behavior when moving through open but regulated waters. This pattern is especially prevalent in segments where vessel draught is moderate ([6, 8) m), indicating sufficient under-keel clearance for steady routing. The behavior pattern vb_-4927443205807001530 is strongly associated with these conditions, supported by high edge weights from key static attributes: navigation_status (w=102), vessel_type (w=73), and hazardous_cargo (w=102). When normalized across all candidate patterns, the cumulative support from vessel-specific static attributes gives this movement the highest contextual likelihood (approximately 68% relative confidence among top candidates), particularly in linear coastal corridors without sharp turns or port approach structures.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable trajectory with consistent speed (~19.3–19.4 knots), minimal course deviation (COG 320.1°–320.7°), fixed heading (323.0°), and a clear linear west-southwest progression. This indicates uninterrupted transit along a fixed maritime route. While the candidate movements include several curved-route behaviors, only vb_-4927443205807001530 matches the intent of \"navigating along a fixed route\" with stable speed, gradual course consistency, and linear parametric modeling—directly aligning with the boundary’s behavioral continuity. The other candidates emphasize curved routing with evolving COG trends incompatible with the observed rigid alignment between heading and COG in the boundary segment. Thus, despite minor differences in absolute speed, vb_-4927443205807001530 best preserves the kinematic and navigational intent across the gap.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the behavior pattern is 98.04%. This is derived from the relative weight distribution between the two candidate functions connected to the behavior pattern vb_-4927443205807001530, where vf_-7663396197665720575 has a weight of 100 and vf_5240413252068673064 has a weight of 2. The proportion is calculated as 100 / (100 + 2) = 100 / 102 ≈ 0.9804, or 98.04%. This indicates a strong statistical preference for vf_-7663396197665720575 based on historical reliability in similar kinematic contexts.  \n2. The function exhibits high motion consistency with the observed vessel dynamics, characterized by stable speed, consistent course over ground (COG), and minimal heading fluctuations. It assumes linear spatial progression proportional to time, which aligns precisely with the parametric trajectory model described in the intent (lat(t) ≈ 56.114153 + 0.00087 × t, lon(t) ≈ 7.607993 + 0.00034 × t). Its design supports uniform temporal interpolation under constant velocity assumptions, making it highly adaptive to straight-line maritime navigation patterns."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) applicable in coastal waters near established shipping lanes; spatial anchor: Kungsbacka kommun, Halland County, Sweden\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a nearly constant speed of 19.3–19.4 knots, minimal course deviation (COG between 320.1° and 320.7°), and fixed heading at 323.0°—is characteristic of vessels transiting through regulated maritime corridors where predictable, linear motion is required for collision avoidance and traffic flow efficiency. This pattern aligns with standard operating procedures in coastal zones adjacent to major shipping routes such as the København–Oslo lane, where cargo vessels without hazardous cargo typically follow designated straight paths under autopilot control. The observed trajectory shows no indication of maneuvering for port entry, anchoring, or navigation around sharp bends, which rules out curved-route behaviors commonly seen near harbors or in confined channels. Instead, the consistent alignment between course over ground and heading, combined with stable propulsion, reflects adherence to a fixed transit route in open but structured waters. Given the moderate draught ([6, 8) m) and typical cargo vessel dimensions (100–150 m length, 20–25 m width), the vessel has sufficient under-keel clearance to maintain uninterrupted progress, further supporting sustained linear navigation. Therefore, this behavior is operationally consistent with regional traffic management practices designed to ensure safe and efficient passage through busy coastal segments.\n'''",
