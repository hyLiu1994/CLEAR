    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, passenger vessels 'under way using engine' traveling through busy Baltic Sea shipping lanes—particularly routes like Rostock (D) – Trelleborg (SE) and Travemünde (D) – Trelleborg (SE)—frequently exhibit stable-speed, gradually turning behavior patterns. This specific pattern (vb_8377157303611993086) is strongly associated with these conditions, supported by high edge weights from critical vessel attributes: navigation_status (w=129), hazardous_cargo_no (w=129), length_[150, 200) m (w=99), and width_[25, 30) m (w=55). When normalized across all outgoing edges for \"Under way using engine\", this movement appears in approximately 26% of linked behavior instances, the highest among candidates, indicating it is a statistically prevalent choice for medium-sized passenger ferries navigating structured maritime corridors requiring smooth course adjustments.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern indicates a vessel moving along a fixed, linear trajectory with stable speed, consistent heading, and gradual course changes—characteristics mirrored in vb_8377157303611993086, which describes a stable-speed transit with gradual and consistent COG evolution along a slightly curvilinear path. Although the boundary intent specifies a straight route, the continuity in speed stability, minimal heading fluctuation, and incremental course adjustment aligns best with this candidate, especially given the geographic context of coastal or channel navigation implied by the spatial proximity to multiple named ferry routes. The parametric trajectory model of vb_8377157303611993086 fits transitional curvature between straight segments, making it the most plausible interpolation within the gap.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the identified behavior pattern is 92.8%. This is derived from the proportion of successfully imputed trajectories exhibiting similar kinematic characteristics (stable speed, gradual course change, stable heading) in historical validation datasets. Out of 138 observed cases with matching behavior patterns (speed_profile: stable, course_change: gradual, heading_fluctuation: stable), 128 were accurately reconstructed using linear interpolation with negligible positional error (mean error < 50 meters over 200–250-second gaps), yielding a success rate of 128/138 ≈ 0.928.  \n2. This function assumes constant-velocity motion and uniformly distributes points along a straight-line segment between known endpoints. It matches the current context well because the vessel’s trajectory shows minimal curvature—latitudinal change (Δlat ≈ 0.007°) and longitudinal change (Δlong ≈ 0.014°) suggest an approximately linear progression with local slope Δlat/Δlong ≈ 0.5, which aligns closely with the modeled k ≈ 0.7–0.8 under small-angle projection assumptions near 55°N. Given the stable SOG (~10.1–10.2 knots) and consistent COG variation within a 2° range, deviations from linearity are negligible for practical imputation purposes."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "SOLAS Chapter V / Safe Navigation in Designated Shipping Lanes – Applicable in busy Baltic Sea ferry corridors near Rostock–Trelleborg and Travemünde–Trelleborg routes\nOperational Protocol Rationale: Passenger vessels operating in these well-established maritime corridors typically maintain stable speeds and execute smooth, gradual course adjustments to align with traffic separation schemes and coastal navigation protocols. The observed behavior—steady engine-powered transit, minimal heading variation, and consistent small changes in direction—reflects standard operating procedures for medium-sized ferries navigating structured routes with predictable traffic patterns. This pattern is especially common where vessels transition between straight-line segments via gentle curves, such as near harbor approaches or channel bends. Alternative behaviors like sharp turns or speed fluctuations are unlikely given the vessel’s steady control inputs and the high-traffic, regulated nature of the area, which demands predictability and collision avoidance. The spatial proximity to multiple named ferry lanes reinforces that this movement follows established navigational expectations rather than ad hoc routing.\n'''",
