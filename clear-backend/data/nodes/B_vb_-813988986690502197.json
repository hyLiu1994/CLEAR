    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 12.8 and 13.2 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly from ~239.6° to ~240.2°, indicating a smooth, intentional course adjustment over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 236.0°–238.0°, showing controlled directional stability)",
