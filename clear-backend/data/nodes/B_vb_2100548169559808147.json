  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 14.8–14.9 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 29.7° and 31.5°, showing a smooth oscillation around a mean course of ~30.5°, indicating minor corrective steering or channel following)",
    "Heading fluctuation: gradual and consistent (heading remains fixed at 32.0° throughout, suggesting autopilot mode with small rudder adjustments to maintain alignment with the desired track)",
