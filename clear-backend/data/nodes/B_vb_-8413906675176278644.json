    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains zero speed across all observations, indicating no forward motion)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (COG varies significantly between 288.9° and 350.1° despite no movement, reflecting sensor updates or rotational maneuvering while stationary)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains nearly constant at 281–282°, suggesting the vessel’s bow orientation is fixed despite COG fluctuations)",
