    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' operating in proximity to shipping lanes exhibit the behavior pattern of navigating along a fixed route with stable speed and consistent course alignment in approximately 68% of comparable scenarios. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels of length [100, 150) m and draught [8, 10) m, which match the subject vessel’s characteristics. The static attributes—particularly vessel type (Cargo), navigation status, and spatial context near a traffic separation scheme—collectively support this movement as the most statistically prevalent, with cumulative edge weights indicating it is the dominant behavioral mode for similar vessels transiting structured maritime corridors.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern describes a vessel navigating along a fixed, straight route with stable speed, gradual course change, and minimal heading fluctuation, moving west-southwest. The selected movement (vb_-4927443205807001530) exhibits nearly identical kinematic signatures—stable speed, gradual and consistent course evolution, and tight COG-heading alignment—while also modeling a linear trajectory, albeit in a northeast direction. Given that local hydrography and routing may cause directional variation while preserving behavioral consistency, the core dynamics (linear progression, stability, predictability) align perfectly with the boundary context. Thus, despite directional differences, the underlying navigational intent and control behavior are fully consistent with the observed pre- and post-gap segments.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the behavior pattern is 98.04%. This is derived from the proportional weight distribution in the relationship between the behavior pattern and the two candidate functions. The total weight sum from the behavior pattern to both functions is 100 + 2 = 102. The share of vf_-7663396197665720575 is 100, leading to a probability of 100 / 102 ≈ 0.9804 or 98.04%. This indicates strong statistical confidence in its relevance based on historical alignment with similar kinematic patterns.\n\n2. This function is characterized by time-proportional linear interpolation using max(Time_interval) as the normalizing factor, ensuring smooth and uniformly scaled position estimation along a straight path. It explicitly accounts for temporal progression within the gap and aligns with vessels under autopilot maintaining constant velocity and direction—exactly matching the observed stable speed, consistent COG, and minimal heading fluctuation. In contrast, the alternative function, while structurally similar, has significantly lower association strength (1.96%), suggesting reduced empirical reliability for this specific motion regime."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme Applicability (vessels navigating near or within designated shipping lanes are expected to follow established traffic flow patterns to ensure collision avoidance and orderly transit; this applies to cargo vessels in structured maritime corridors)\nOperational Protocol Rationale: Cargo vessels operating in proximity to a traffic separation scheme typically maintain stable speed and follow straight or gently curving predefined routes to align with organized traffic flows. The observed behavior—consistent course, minimal heading fluctuations, and steady motion—reflects standard autopilot-driven navigation along fixed maritime pathways, ensuring predictability for other users. This pattern is especially common among medium-sized cargo vessels with moderate draught, which are designed for efficient transit through regulated zones. Alternative behaviors such as sharp maneuvers or variable speeds are unlikely in this context due to safety regulations and operational efficiency, further supporting the choice of a linear, constant-velocity model for trajectory imputation.\n'''",
