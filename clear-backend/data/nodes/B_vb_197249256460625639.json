  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (the persistent zero speed with varying COG while heading remains constant indicates the vessel is stationary but swinging due to tidal or wind forces; position remains nearly constant at latitude: 56.151458, longitude: 10.236068, forming a point-like trajectory with no significant displacement, consistent with anchoring or mooring behavior)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a constant speed of 0.0 knots across all observations, indicating no movement)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (the COG varies significantly between 148.0° and 183.3° despite zero speed, suggesting the vessel is rotating in place or responding to environmental forces)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (the heading remains fixed at 41.0° throughout the observation period, even as COG changes, indicating the vessel is not actively steering)",
    "Behavior intent: anchored or moored in a confined area (the persistent zero speed with varying COG while heading remains constant indicates the vessel is stationary but swinging due to tidal or wind forces; position remains nearly constant at latitude: 56.151458, longitude: 10.236068, forming a point-like trajectory with no significant displacement, consistent with anchoring or mooring behavior)",
