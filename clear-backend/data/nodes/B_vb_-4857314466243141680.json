    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 10.2 and 10.9 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slowly between 351.7° and 359.0°, showing a smooth evolution over time, indicative of a controlled turn or curved path)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains nearly constant at 2–4°, indicating the vessel’s orientation is steady with only minor adjustments)",
