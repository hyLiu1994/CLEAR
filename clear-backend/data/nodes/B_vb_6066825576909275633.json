    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed around 14.8–15.0 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (the COG varies between 26.7° and 35.6°, showing small but repeated oscillations despite consistent heading)",
    "Heading fluctuation: gradual and consistent (the heading remains fixed at 33.0° throughout, indicating no active rudder correction or sensor update, while COG fluctuates around it)",
