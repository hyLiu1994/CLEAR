  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed, gradually decreasing from 4.0 to 2.4 knots over an extended period, indicating controlled movement without abrupt changes)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases slowly from 19.0° to 21.3°, reflecting a smooth, intentional turn or alignment with a curved channel)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains at 19.0° for most of the segment, then shifts to 20.0°, showing minimal oscillation, consistent with autopilot or track-keeping system)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation:",
