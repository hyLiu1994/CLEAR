  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route forms a small elliptical pattern, approximated by a parametric equation of a circle with radius ~20 meters:, where t ∈ [0,1] represents normalized time over the loop; this reflects the vessel turning in place or adjusting position within a confined harbor area, likely during docking preparation or anchoring",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a low and nearly constant speed between 0.1 and 0.6 knots, indicating minimal propulsion changes)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG evolves smoothly from ~264° to ~39°, then to ~171°, showing a continuous clockwise turn over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading decreases gradually from 285° to 277°, remaining within a narrow 8° range, suggesting controlled rudder input)",
