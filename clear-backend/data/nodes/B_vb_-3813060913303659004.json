  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 12.8 and 13.1 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slowly from 239.9° to 237.0°, then increases slightly to 241.3°, indicating a smooth evolution in direction over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains tightly clustered around 235°–238°, with only minor fluctuations of ±1.5°, suggesting precise steering control)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
