  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 6.8 and 7.0 knots across consecutive records, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG decreases steadily from 71.6° to 57.5° over successive observations, reflecting a smooth, intentional turn)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading varies only slightly from 69.0° to 55.0°, remaining closely aligned with COG, suggesting controlled steering without oscillation)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
