    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a speed of 0.0 knots, indicating it is stationary or drifting slightly)",
    "Course change: stable (COG remains constant at 111.6°, showing no change in direction despite lack of movement)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading fluctuates minimally around 60°, with only a 1° variation observed, consistent with a moored or anchored vessel swinging slightly due to wind or current)",
