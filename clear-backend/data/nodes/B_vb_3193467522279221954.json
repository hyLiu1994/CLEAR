    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 13.0 and 13.2 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG remains stable at approximately 104.8°, with only a minor adjustment to 104.3° later in the sequence, indicating a smooth, intentional course)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading fluctuates slightly around 103°–104°, within 1°, suggesting minimal rudder activity and stable steering)",
    "Behavior intent: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving east-southeast, approximated by the parametric equations:",
