    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 15.8 and 16.0 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases slightly from 119.6° to 120.3°, showing a smooth, steady change within a narrow range)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains fixed at 119.0° throughout, indicating no yawing or steering adjustments)",
