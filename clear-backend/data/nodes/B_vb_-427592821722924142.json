    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 9.0 and 9.2 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies narrowly between 189.5° and 191.1°, showing a smooth progression without abrupt changes)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains tightly around 189.0°–190.0°, indicating precise directional control)",
