    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 15.1 and 15.3 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG decreases slowly and consistently from 107.5° to 100.3°, indicating a smooth turn to the right over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: gradual and consistent (heading decreases gradually from 104.0° to 97.0°, closely tracking COG with small, stable differences)",
