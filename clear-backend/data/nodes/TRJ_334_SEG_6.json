      "intent": "following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",

      "intent": "following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation:",
