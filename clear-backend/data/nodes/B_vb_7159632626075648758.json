    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of 17.1–17.2 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 339.8° and 340.4°, indicating a smooth, controlled progression without abrupt turns)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains fixed at 341.0°, showing minimal deviation despite small COG changes, typical in calm sea conditions or autopilot use)",
