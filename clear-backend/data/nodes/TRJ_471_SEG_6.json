    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, tankers 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo navigating near major shipping lanes such as Langelandsbælt exhibit curved route-following behavior in 72% of comparable segments, particularly when maintaining stable speed and gradual course changes. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels of length [100, 150) m and draught [4, 6) m, which match the subject vessel’s specifications. The high edge weights (w=113) from navigation status and cargo type indicate that this movement is typical for active tanker transits in constrained waterways, where controlled turns are required due to channel geometry. Among all candidate patterns, this behavior co-occurs most frequently with similar vessel profiles in the same spatial context.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement patterns show a consistent trend of gradual starboard turns (COG increasing from 329.4° to 353.6° across adjacent segments) with stable speed and minimal heading fluctuation—indicative of a continuous curved trajectory. The selected movement (vb_-24485554849544898) aligns precisely with this evolution, describing a smooth turn to the right under stable propulsion, matching both the directional trend and dynamic stability observed before and after the gap. Furthermore, the incomplete AIS samples trace a northward-curving path consistent with the polynomial trajectory modeled in this pattern, confirming spatial and kinematic continuity across the missing block.\n'''"

This pattern aligns with standard maritime practices for following predefined curved routes in regulated zones, as evidenced by the continuous evolution of course over ground before and after the data gap. Alternative behaviors such as erratic maneuvering or abrupt course changes are inconsistent with both the vessel’s stable dynamics and the spatial constraints of a busy shipping lane, further supporting that a controlled, curved trajectory is the expected operational norm under local navigation rules.\n'''",
