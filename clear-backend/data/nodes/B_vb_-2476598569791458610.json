    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a low and nearly constant speed, typically between 0.0 and 0.4 knots, indicating minimal movement)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (the COG changes significantly, from approximately 238° to 354°, then shifting to 174°, and back to 354°, indicating repeated small adjustments in direction)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (the heading remains almost constant at 354°–355°, with only minor deviations, suggesting the vessel’s bow is aligned in a fixed direction despite COG changes)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route forms a small elliptical pattern, approximated by a parametric equation of a circle with radius ~20 meters",
