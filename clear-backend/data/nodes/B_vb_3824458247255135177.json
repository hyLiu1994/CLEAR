    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 15.8 and 16.3 knots with minimal variation, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly from 225.1° to 224.5° over the sequence, showing a smooth, intentional adjustment in direction)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains almost constant at 224.0°, with only one observation at 223.0°, indicating stable rudder control and no erratic yawing)",
    "Behavior intent: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving westsouthwest, approximated by the parametric equations:",
