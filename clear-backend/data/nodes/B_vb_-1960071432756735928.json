  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (the combination of zero speed (SOG = 0.0), repeated small oscillations in position around latitude ~56.1586 and longitude ~14.8162, and stable heading/COD suggests the vessel is not underway; the position dispersion forms a tight cluster <20 meters in diameter, consistent with GPS noise or minor swinging at anchor; this pattern is used to impute position as the centroid: lat ≈ 56.15863, lon ≈ 14.81625 when SOG = 0 and COG/heading remain stable)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains zero speed across multiple observations, indicating no movement)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (COG remains nearly constant at ~9.9° despite positional noise, but this is likely due to reporting artifacts when speed is zero)",
    "Heading fluctuation: gradual and consistent (heading varies slightly between 193° and 194°, typical of a stationary vessel responding to wind or current without propulsion)",
    "Behavior intent: anchored or moored in a confined area (the combination of zero speed (SOG = 0.0), repeated small oscillations in position around latitude ~56.1586 and longitude ~14.8162, and stable heading/COD suggests the vessel is not underway; the position dispersion forms a tight cluster <20 meters in diameter, consistent with GPS noise or minor swinging at anchor; this pattern is used to impute position as the centroid: lat ≈ 56.15863, lon ≈ 14.81625 when SOG = 0 and COG/heading remain stable)",
