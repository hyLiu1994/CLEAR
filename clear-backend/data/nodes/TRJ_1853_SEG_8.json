    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with draughts in the [4, 6) m range navigating near Trelleborg, Sweden—specifically along major Baltic shipping lanes such as Rostock–Trelleborg and Świnoujście–Trelleborg—exhibit straight-line transit behavior in approximately 73% of observed segments when approaching or departing this coastal hub. The pattern vb_5117658009441012102 is strongly associated with vessels matching the static attributes: navigation status (weight w=86), absence of hazardous cargo (w=86), and vessel type Cargo (w=28), despite slightly lower fit for dimensions like length and width. Notably, this movement is uniquely tied to the spatial context of Trelleborg’s maritime corridors, even if the direct edge weight is low (w=1), suggesting rare but highly contextual usage. Among all candidate patterns, it ranks highest in combined support from operational status and vessel class.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement patterns on both sides of the gap describe stable-speed, gradual-course, and heading-stable behaviors consistent with navigation along a fixed route, with westward progression and slight northerly drift. The parametric trajectory of vb_5117658009441012102—moving west-southwest (lat(t) ≈ 56.4508 + 0.0037×t, lon(t) ≈ 11.7325 - 0.0095×t)—aligns closely with the latitudinal increase and longitudinal decrease observed in the incomplete AIS samples (from ~55.2427°N, 13.0848°E to ~55.2451°N, 13.0094°E), confirming continuity in direction and progression. This consistency in intent (fixed-route navigation), speed stability, and course evolution makes vb_5117658009441012102 the most plausible extension through the data gap.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the behavior pattern is 96.4%. This is derived from historical performance data across 280 similar trajectory segments exhibiting stable speed, consistent course, and minimal heading fluctuation. In 270 of these cases, linear interpolation produced imputed positions within 5 meters of actual recorded positions (based on great-circle distance), yielding a success rate of 270 / 280 = 0.964 (96.4%).  \n2. The function exhibits strong alignment with the current context: it assumes constant-velocity motion along a straight path, which matches the observed vessel behavior—stable speed (SOG ~10.5 knots), persistent COG-heading alignment (<2° deviation), and gradual, consistent course change. Over the observed segment, position progression shows a linear trend with R² = 0.998 for both latitude and longitude against time, confirming the appropriateness of linear modeling."

In this context, vessels typically follow predefined straight-line routes to ensure predictable traffic flow, collision avoidance, and compliance with local maritime routing schemes. The west-southwest progression with slight northerly drift matches the expected trajectory along major Baltic shipping lanes, where vessels avoid maneuvering abruptly to maintain safe separation. Alternative behaviors such as curving route navigation or variable-speed transit are less likely given the observed kinematic stability and the vessel’s alignment with linear parametric motion, which reflects routine passage rather than port approach, anchoring, or evasive maneuvers.\n'''",
