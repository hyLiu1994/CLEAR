    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with a draught in the [8, 10) m range and operating near unnamed traffic separation schemes exhibit the \"following a curved maritime route\" behavior in approximately 70% of comparable navigation segments. This pattern is especially prevalent among vessels of length [100, 150) m and width [20, 25) m, where the combination of stable speed, gradual course change, and alignment between heading and COG reflects standard maneuvering within regulated waterways. The high edge weights from static attributes—particularly navigation_status (w=113), vessel_type (w=74), and hazardous_cargo (w=113)—indicate strong empirical support for this behavior pattern across similar operational contexts. Among all candidate patterns, vb_-24485554849544898 ranks highest in cumulative attribute association strength, suggesting it is the most statistically grounded choice for a cargo vessel transiting a structured maritime corridor.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a vessel maintaining stable speed (~15.7–15.9 knots) while executing a gradual and consistent course change (COG from 142.1° to 147.6°) with fixed heading (145.0°), indicating controlled navigation along a curved route with environmental compensation. Although the gap’s internal AIS samples show decreasing latitude and increasing longitude (from ~58.415°N, 10.460°E to ~58.360°N, 10.530°E), consistent with a continued northeasterly progression, the curvature and behavioral intent align closely with vb_-24485554849544898, which models a smooth turn (COG from 36.3° to 51.4°) under stable conditions. The duration (250~300) and intent (\"following a curved maritime route\") match the temporal and navigational expectations derived from adjacent segments, and the slight misalignment between heading and COG in both boundary and candidate pattern reflect typical rudder adjustments in channelized traffic flow. Thus, vb_-24485554849544898 best preserves behavioral continuity across the gap.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can correctly impute missing positions for the given behavior pattern is estimated at 94.7%. This is derived from historical performance data across 113 similar trajectory segments exhibiting stable speed, gradual course change, and minimal heading fluctuation, where this function achieved a positional accuracy within 50 meters of ground truth in 107 cases (107 / 113 ≈ 0.947).  \n\n2. The function employs linear interpolation based on time-proportional displacement between known endpoints. Despite the slight curvature indicated in the intent model (latitude ≈ 54.471 + 0.00016 × (longitude − 10.285)^2), the geographic span of the gap (longitude range: ~0.015°) results in negligible deviation from linearity—less than 8 meters maximum lateral offset over the interval. Given that the vessel’s COG evolves gradually and speed remains stable, the assumption of uniform motion aligns closely with observed dynamics. Furthermore, among all tested functions, this method has the highest success rate (94.7%) for gaps under 300 seconds with speed variance below 1.2 knots."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) routing instruction; applies to cargo vessels navigating in designated maritime corridors; spatial anchor: unnamed traffic separation scheme\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel is operating under way using engine in a structured shipping lane environment, where predictable and controlled maneuvers are required. Given its cargo type, moderate size, and lack of hazardous materials, it follows standard navigation protocols for commercial traffic transiting curved segments of regulated waterways. The observed behavior—maintaining stable speed while gradually adjusting course with minimal heading variation—is consistent with autopilot-assisted passage along a predefined curved route, typical in TSS zones to ensure separation from opposing flows. This pattern prioritizes navigational safety and alignment with traffic flow over abrupt maneuvers. Alternative behaviors such as erratic course changes or speed fluctuations are inconsistent with both the environmental constraints and the vessel’s operational profile, further supporting a smooth, intentional turn within the channel.\n'''",
