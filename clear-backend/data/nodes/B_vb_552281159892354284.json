  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (the vessel shows no movement in position over time—latitude and longitude remain nearly unchanged—and zero SOG confirms it is not under way; however, fluctuating COG with stable heading suggests the vessel is swinging at anchor due to wind or current while maintaining its heading reference; this behavior is typical of vessels at anchor in a sheltered harbor or mooring point, where position remains fixed within sensor precision: lat ≈ 56.15146 ± 0.000002, lon ≈ 10.236055 ± 0.000002)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a speed of 0.0 knots across all observations, indicating no movement)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (the COG varies significantly from 146.5° to 201.1° and back, despite zero speed, suggesting the vessel is rotating in place or responding to environmental forces)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (the heading remains constant at 41.0° throughout, indicating the vessel’s bow is fixed in direction despite changes in COG)",
    "Behavior intent: anchored or moored in a confined area (the vessel shows no movement in position over time—latitude and longitude remain nearly unchanged—and zero SOG confirms it is not under way; however, fluctuating COG with stable heading suggests the vessel is swinging at anchor due to wind or current while maintaining its heading reference; this behavior is typical of vessels at anchor in a sheltered harbor or mooring point, where position remains fixed within sensor precision: lat ≈ 56.15146 ± 0.000002, lon ≈ 10.236055 ± 0.000002)",
