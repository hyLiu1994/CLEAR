    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 6.4 and 6.7 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly from 39.0° to 35.9° over time, indicating a smooth, progressive turn to the right)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains close to 40.0°, with only minor adjustments, suggesting controlled rudder input)",
