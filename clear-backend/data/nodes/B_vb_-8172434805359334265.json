  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving east-southeast, approximated by the parametric equations: lat(t) ≈ 57.0475 + Δt·v·cos(θ), lon(t) ≈ 10.0544 + Δt·v·sin(θ), where v = 0 (stationary), θ = 111.6°, resulting in tightly clustered positions around (57.0475, 10.0544) due to GPS noise or buoyancy swing)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a speed of 0.0 knots across all observations, indicating it is stationary or drifting in place)",
    "Course change: stable (COG remains constant at 111.6°, showing no change in the direction of movement despite positional noise)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading oscillates slightly between 59.0° and 60.0°, within a 1° range, suggesting minimal yaw due to wind or current while moored or at anchor)",
