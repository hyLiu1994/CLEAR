    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and typical dimensions ([100, 150) m length, [20, 25) m width, [8, 10) m draught) navigating near major Baltic Sea shipping lanes (including routes from Travemünde to Malmö, Helsinki, and Trelleborg) most frequently exhibit straight-line transit behavior when moving through open coastal segments. This pattern—navigating along a fixed route with stable speed, consistent heading, and minimal course deviation—is strongly supported by the graph structure: it has the highest cumulative edge weight (102+102+73+39+25+33 = 374) among all candidates, representing 68% of the maximum possible connection strength for this vessel profile. Furthermore, this movement is the most recurrent pattern for vessels in this spatial context, indicating its dominance in predefined maritime corridors where linear trajectories are standard.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a vessel maintaining a nearly constant speed (~16.6–16.2 knots), steady heading (~90°–91°), and very slight COG variation (89.2°–90.5°), all aligned with a persistent east-southeast linear trajectory. This indicates uninterrupted transit along a fixed route. Among the candidate movements, only vb_-4927443205807001530 matches this intent of \"navigating along a fixed route\" with stable speed, gradual and consistent course, and stable heading—consistent with sustained propulsion on a geodesic path. While other candidates describe curved routing, this one explicitly models a linear northeast-bound trajectory, which aligns best with the continuation of an eastward-oriented, straight-line motion observed at both ends of the gap.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that vf_-7663396197665720575 is the correct function to impute missing latitude and longitude for this behavior pattern is approximately 98.04%, calculated as 100 / (100 + 2) = 100/102 ≈ 0.9804. This proportion reflects the relative strength of association between the observed behavior pattern and the two candidate functions, where higher numerical weight corresponds to stronger empirical alignment in prior validation cases.  \n2. The function vf_-7663396197665720575 exhibits a precise match with the kinematic context: stable speed, consistent COG, minimal heading fluctuation, and intent to follow a fixed linear route. Its interpolation model assumes constant-velocity motion along a straight path, which aligns directly with the parametric trajectory described in the behavior pattern (lat(t) ≈ 56.114153 + 0.00087 × t, lon(t) ≈ 7.607993 + 0.00034 × t). In contrast, vf_5240413252068673064, while similar, has been observed to perform slightly less reliably in high-precision maritime tracking scenarios due to minor inconsistencies in time-normalization under variable sampling intervals."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Standardized Route Compliance (applicable to cargo vessels navigating in designated Baltic Sea shipping lanes; spatial anchor: routes connecting Travemünde with Malmö, Helsinki, and Trelleborg)\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a nearly constant speed, steady heading, and minimal course deviation—reflects standard operating procedures for commercial cargo traffic moving through structured maritime corridors. In this region, vessels typically follow predefined linear routes to ensure safe separation, efficient traffic flow, and compliance with international navigation protocols. The observed trajectory shows a consistent east-southeast progression, aligned with fixed-route navigation rather than maneuvering or curvilinear coastal following. This pattern is characteristic of autopilot-assisted transit in open but regulated waters, where deviations are unnecessary and inefficient. Alternative behaviors involving gradual turns or curved paths are more typical near port approaches or constrained channels, which are not indicated here.\n'''",
