  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (the persistent zero speed (SOG = 0.0) combined with fixed position (latitude ~56.15146, longitude ~10.23605) and varying COG indicates the vessel is not underway but likely anchored or moored; the position remains within a radius of less than 10 meters over time, forming a stationary point with minor GPS noise, modeled as a single coordinate: lat ≈ 56.15146, lon ≈ 10.23605)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains zero speed across all observations, indicating no movement)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (the COG varies significantly from 105.5° to 171.4° despite no motion, reflecting sensor updates or drifting values while stationary)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (the heading remains constant at 41.0°, suggesting the vessel is fixed in orientation while not moving)",
