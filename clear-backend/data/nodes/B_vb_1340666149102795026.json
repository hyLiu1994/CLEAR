    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 6.4 and 6.5 knots over multiple observations, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes very slightly from 183.9° to 182.2°, showing a smooth, almost linear progression in direction)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading varies only between 182.0° and 184.0°, indicating minimal yaw and controlled steering)",
