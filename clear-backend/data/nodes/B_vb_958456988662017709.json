    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 10.7 and 10.9 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 189.7° and 196.9°, indicating a slow, controlled turn or route curvature)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 195°–199°, with minimal short-term variation)",
