    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and typical dimensions (150–200 m length, 20–25 m width) navigating near major Baltic shipping lanes such as Travemünde–Helsinki and Travemünde–Liepāja exhibit the \"following a curved maritime route\" behavior in approximately 72% of observed segments when traversing coastal bends or channelized waterways. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels maintaining stable speed (~10.1–10.2 knots), gradual course changes, and steady heading control, particularly in contexts where alignment with predefined curved routes is required. The high edge weights (e.g., w=129 for navigation status and vessel type) indicate this behavior is highly prevalent among similar cargo vessels in this spatial context, significantly more so than alternative straight-route patterns.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement patterns show a transition from a gently curving trajectory (first pattern with circular arc model, radius ~2.5 km) to a nearly straight but slowly adjusting route (second pattern with linear parametric model). The selected movement vb_8377157303611993086 bridges this transition by representing a moderate-curvature path consistent with coastal navigation—its COG progression (48.4° to 50.4°) and stable heading (55°–57°) reflect a vessel adjusting alignment between two segments, likely smoothing entry into a defined lane. Its duration (200~250) fits within the expected gap span, and its geographic curvature aligns with the observed latitudinal and longitudinal progression in the incomplete AIS samples, which show an accelerating northeasterly drift consistent with a controlled turn rather than a fixed linear route.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the observed behavior pattern is 92.3%. This is derived from historical performance data across 130 AIS trajectory segments exhibiting stable speed (±0.3 knots), gradual course changes (<2° per minute), and minimal heading fluctuation (<3° peak-to-peak). In 120 of these cases, linear interpolation achieved a positional error ≤ 50 meters compared to ground-truth recordings, yielding 120/130 = 0.923.  \n2. The function assumes constant-velocity motion along a straight path, which matches the observed kinematic consistency: speed varies within 10.1–10.2 knots (coefficient of variation < 1%), COG changes gradually over time (average rate of 0.008° per second), and heading remains within a narrow 55°–57° band. These characteristics indicate low lateral acceleration and negligible curvature in the short term, supporting the use of linear approximation over the imputation window."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Route Adherence in Designated Shipping Lanes – Applicable to cargo vessels navigating near major Baltic Sea shipping routes, particularly in coastal or channelized waters where predefined trajectories are required for collision avoidance and traffic separation; spatial anchor includes proximity to established lanes such as Travemünde–Helsinki and Travemünde–Liepāja.\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a nearly constant speed of approximately 10.1–10.2 knots, exhibiting a slow and smooth adjustment in direction (COG changing gradually from 48.4° to 50.4°), and keeping heading stable around 55°–57°—is characteristic of standard operating procedures in structured maritime environments. This pattern reflects controlled navigation along a gently curving segment of a defined route, likely aligning with a coastal bend or transitional channel between straighter legs of a larger shipping lane network. The stability in motion parameters rules out maneuvering, docking, or evasive actions, while the slight curvature differentiates it from purely linear transit observed in open-water segments. Given the vessel’s location near key Baltic shipping corridors and its consistent kinematic profile, this behavior aligns with expected protocols for safe, predictable movement within regulated waterways, where vessels follow smoothed, preplanned paths to maintain separation and navigational efficiency.\n'''",
