  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 15.6–15.8 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 215.5° and 216.8°, showing a slow, continuous adjustment typical of navigation along a curved or segmented maritime route)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains tightly clustered around 215°–216°, with minimal deviation, indicating steady steering input)",
