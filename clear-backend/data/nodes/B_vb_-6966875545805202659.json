    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a near-zero speed, with SOG consistently at 0.0 or very close to it)",
    "Course change: stable (COG remains constant at 111.6° across all observations, indicating no change in intended direction despite lack of movement)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading is fixed at 60.0° throughout the sequence, showing no yawing or rotational adjustments)",
    "Behavior intent: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving east-southeast, approximated by the parametric equations:",
