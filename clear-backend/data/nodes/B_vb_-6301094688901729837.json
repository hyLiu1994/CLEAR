  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial: lat(t) ≈ 58.4329 - 0.0072 × t + 0.0001 × t², lon(t) ≈ 10.4363 + 0.0135 × t + 0.0002 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 15.7–15.9 knots across the trajectory segment)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 142.1° and 147.6°, showing a slow and smooth evolution over time, indicating a controlled turn or curved path)",
    "Heading fluctuation: gradual and consistent (heading remains fixed at 145.0° throughout, while COG changes around it, suggesting the vessel is compensating for environmental forces like current or wind during a curved navigation)",
