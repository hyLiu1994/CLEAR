    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 15.8 and 16.1 knots, with only minor gradual decreases)",
    "Course change: stable (COG remains consistently at 28.0° across most observations, with only one minor deviation to 27.6°, indicating negligible course change)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading is fixed at 28.0° throughout the entire sequence, showing no fluctuation)",
