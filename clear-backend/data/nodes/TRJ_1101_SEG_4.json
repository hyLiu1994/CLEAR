    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with a draught of 8–10 meters and dimensions in the 150–200 m length and 25–30 m width range are observed to follow fixed-route navigation patterns along major shipping lanes in approximately 62% of cases when traversing open waters near established routes such as Travemünde–Helsinki. The high edge weight (w=62) between the vessel’s static attributes and this behavior pattern—particularly for vessels without hazardous cargo—indicates strong statistical prevalence. Among all candidate movements, this pattern ranks highest in alignment with both vessel type and operational status, and it is one of only two patterns associated with straight-line westward motion consistent with regional traffic flow.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable speed (~16.1–16.2 knots), gradual course change (241.0° to 239.8°), and intent to navigate a fixed linear route moving west-southwest. The selected movement vb_3366872286460794881 exhibits nearly identical characteristics: stable speed (15.2–15.3 knots), minimal COG variation (274.1° to 274.8°), fixed heading (273.0°), and intent to follow a fixed route with uniform westward progression. Although the absolute bearing differs slightly, the kinematic profile—stable speed, negligible heading fluctuation, and smooth directional maintenance—is fully consistent with the continuity expected across the gap. Moreover, the parametric trajectory model of the selected pattern reflects uniform motion along a great-circle arc, which aligns with the linear extrapolation implied by the boundary segments.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that function `vf_5240413252068673064` correctly addresses the missing value problem given the observed behavior pattern is 98.4%. This is derived from the relative weight distribution between the two candidate functions in the context of the same behavioral pattern: the total association weight for both functions is 61 + 1 = 62, and the proportion of support for `vf_5240413252068673064` is 61 / 62 ≈ 0.9839, or 98.4%. This high proportion indicates a strong empirical alignment between this function and the kinematic behavior characterized by stable speed, consistent COG, and fixed heading.  \n2. The function exhibits precise temporal scaling using normalized time intervals (`t / Time_interval[-1]`), which ensures uniform progression along the trajectory. In contrast, the alternative function uses `max(Time_interval)` without explicit reference to the final index, potentially introducing minor misalignment in non-uniform sampling scenarios. Given the vessel’s near-constant velocity (15.2–15.3 knots) and linear westward motion, the use of `Time_interval[-1]` as the normalizing factor provides superior synchronization with actual elapsed time, enhancing positional accuracy."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "SOLAS Chapter V, Regulation 19 – Mandatory use of routing systems; applies to all cargo vessels over 50m in length navigating within designated shipping lanes; spatial anchor: waters near Travemünde–Helsinki and Travemünde–Liepāja routes\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel is a cargo ship operating under way with engine, following a stable, straight westward trajectory at consistent speed and heading. This behavior is typical for vessels transiting established maritime corridors where traffic separation schemes are enforced to ensure safe passage through high-density areas. The minimal variation in course and heading reflects autopilot-assisted navigation along predefined routes, which reduces collision risk and aligns with international best practices for open-water transit. Alternative behaviors such as maneuvering, anchoring, or sharp course changes are inconsistent with the observed kinematic stability and the structured flow of traffic in these lanes. The presence of nearby major shipping routes further supports adherence to fixed-route navigation, as deviations would require explicit intent not indicated by the data.\n'''",
