    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 12.7 and 12.8 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 223.0° and 223.8°, indicating a very smooth and sustained course direction with minimal deviation)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains fixed at 223.0° or 224.0°, showing no significant yawing or corrective steering)",
