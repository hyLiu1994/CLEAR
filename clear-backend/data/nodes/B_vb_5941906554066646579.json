  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation:",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed, with SOG varying only slightly from 9.9 to 9.5 knots over multiple observations)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases steadily from 194.7° to 209.1°, indicating a smooth, continuous turn to the right)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains close to COG with small deviations, changing gradually from 193.0° to 214.0°, suggesting controlled steering without oscillation)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation:",
