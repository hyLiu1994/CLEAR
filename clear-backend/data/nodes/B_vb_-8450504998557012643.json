    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of 0.1–0.2 knots across the sequence, indicating minimal propulsion changes)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG shifts from ~225° to ~270° over the sequence, showing a smooth, progressive turn to the west, typical of maneuvering in confined waters)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains between 273° and 285°, varying by only ~12°, suggesting controlled rudder input without oscillation)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial: lat(t) ≈ 53.88136 - 0.00062 × t + 0.00008 × t², lon(t) ≈ 9.102013 - 0.00084 × t - 0.00006 × t², where t ∈ [0,1] is normalized time across the segment)",
