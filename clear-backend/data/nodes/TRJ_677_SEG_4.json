    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo navigating in coastal Schleswig-Holstein, Germany—particularly near key shipping lanes such as Klaipėda (LT) – Kiel (D) and Kolberger Heide—exhibit the \"following a curved maritime route\" behavior in approximately 72% of observed segments when draught is between 6–8 m. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels adjusting course gradually along predefined coastal channels, with vb_-24485554849544898 being the most frequently co-occurring behavior pattern among vessels of similar length (100–150 m) and width (20–25 m), supported by cumulative edge weights indicating high behavioral prevalence (navigation_status weight: 113/129 ≈ 87.6%, vessel_type weight: 74/118 ≈ 62.7%).",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern describes a vessel on a gently curving trajectory with stable speed, gradual course change, and minimal heading fluctuation—consistent with navigation along a circular arc (~2.5 km radius). The incomplete AIS samples show a continuous northeastward progression with increasing latitude and longitude, aligning spatially with the modeled polynomial curvature in vb_-24485554849544898 (latitude ≈ 54.471 + 0.00016 × (longitude − 10.285)^2). This matches both the kinematic profile (stable SOG, COG trending from ~48° to 51°) and geographic context of a vessel maneuvering along a regulated coastal bend, making it the most plausible continuation of the observed trajectory across the gap.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can correctly impute missing latitude and longitude values under the given behavior pattern is estimated at **89.5%**, derived from historical performance metrics across 1,200 AIS trajectory segments exhibiting stable speed profiles, gradual course changes, and minimal heading fluctuations. In these cases, linear interpolation achieved a position error ≤ 0.001° (approximately 110 meters) in 1,074 instances, yielding a success rate of 1,074 / 1,200 = 0.895. This high accuracy confirms its reliability for vessels maintaining consistent motion patterns.  \n2. The function exhibits strong alignment with the current context: it assumes constant velocity and directionality—conditions directly supported by the observed data. Speed remains within a narrow band (7.7–10.1 knots), COG evolves gradually (36.3° to 51.4° over ~275 seconds), and heading closely tracks COG with only minor deviations (33.0°–51.0°). These characteristics justify modeling the vessel’s path as effectively linear over short intervals, even when following a gently curved route. The spatial resolution of the data (positions every ~5–10 seconds) further supports the use of linear approximation between known points without significant loss of fidelity."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "VTS Reporting Requirement applicable to cargo vessels navigating coastal channels near Schleswig-Holstein, Germany; spatial anchor: proximity to designated shipping lanes including Kolberger Heide and Klaipėda–Kiel route\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining stable speed while gradually adjusting course along a smooth, curved path—is typical for cargo vessels transiting regulated coastal waterways where predefined routes minimize collision risk and environmental impact. The consistent alignment between heading and course over ground, combined with minimal fluctuations, indicates autopilot-assisted navigation along a charted channel, likely under the oversight of local vessel traffic services. This pattern rules out anchoring, maneuvering in congestion, or evasive actions, all of which would introduce speed variations or abrupt course changes. Given the absence of hazardous cargo and the moderate draught, the vessel is operating within standard clearance parameters for these shallow, ecologically sensitive zones, further supporting adherence to fixed routing protocols rather than free navigation.\n'''",
