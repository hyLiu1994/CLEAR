    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of 6.5–6.7 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG decreases slowly and consistently from ~12° to ~0°, indicating a smooth westward turn)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within 0°–15°, showing minimal oscillation around the COG trend)",
