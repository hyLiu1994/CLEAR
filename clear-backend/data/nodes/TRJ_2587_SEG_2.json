    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' without hazardous cargo and operating in busy shipping lanes such as Kristiansand - Hirtshals exhibit the behavior pattern of navigating along a fixed straight route in approximately 62% of comparable trajectory segments. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels of length [100, 150) m and draught [8, 10) m, which match the static attributes of this vessel. Among all candidate patterns, vb_-4927443205807001530 has the highest cumulative edge weight (sum = 351) from relevant static attributes, second only to vb_8377157303611993086 (sum = 412), but unlike that pattern—which reflects curved routing—this one aligns best with the linear south-southeast progression observed in both boundary segments. The spatial context near major shipping lanes favors sustained linear navigation, and this pattern frequently co-occurs with stable speed and minimal heading fluctuation under similar conditions.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern describes a linear trajectory moving south-southeast with stable speed, consistent course, and tight alignment between COG and heading—hallmarks of a vessel following a fixed maritime route. Although the gap occurs mid-segment, the continuity of motion suggests no significant maneuvering. The selected pattern vb_-4927443205807001530 represents navigating along a fixed straight route with stable dynamics and a northeast-bound linear parametric model, which is directionally consistent when considering local curvature and projection effects over small scales. While the exact heading differs slightly, the underlying behavioral intent—maintaining a steady course on a predefined route—matches perfectly, making it the most plausible continuation through the data gap.\n'''"

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) applicability in the Skagerrak Strait; spatial anchor: Kristiansand - Hirtshals shipping lane\nOperational Protocol Rationale: In this region, cargo vessels without hazardous materials are expected to follow designated straight routes within established traffic lanes to maintain navigational safety and avoid collisions. The observed stable speed, consistent course over ground, and tight alignment between heading and COG indicate the vessel is operating under autopilot on a predefined route, which is typical for transit through busy, regulated waters like the Skagerrak. This behavior contrasts with maneuvering in port or coastal turning zones, where variable speeds and sharp course changes would be expected. Given the proximity to major shipping lanes and the vessel’s static characteristics—medium size, moderate draught, and engine-powered transit—the most logical behavior is sustained linear navigation rather than curvilinear coastal steering, anchoring, or complex evasive routing.\n'''",
