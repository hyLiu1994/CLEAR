    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and typical dimensions (100–150 m length, 20–25 m width, draught 6–8 m) navigating in Swedish coastal waters exhibit straight-line routing behavior in 62% of observed segments when connected through high-weight edges (cumulative weight = 102/129 ≈ 79% relative to the strongest candidate). This pattern is strongly associated with predefined maritime routes near Öckerö kommun, where vessel dynamics show stable speed, minimal course deviation, and consistent heading—indicative of autopilot-assisted transit in open but regulated waters. The movement vb_-4927443205807001530 ranks second in overall edge weight support after vb_8377157303611993086, but surpasses it in intent alignment with linear trajectory behavior.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a vessel maintaining a stable speed (~15.2–15.9 knots), nearly constant heading (343.0°), and a gradually evolving COG (342.5°–344.3°), all aligned with a linear west-southwest progression. This indicates sustained navigation along a fixed route. Among the candidates, only vb_-4927443205807001530 shares the same \"navigating along a fixed route\" intent with stable speed, gradual course change, and tightly aligned COG-heading dynamics. While other candidates describe curved routing, this one models a linear northeast trajectory—matching the structural form of the boundary behavior despite directional differences. Its duration range (200~250) aligns perfectly with the gap’s temporal span, and its parametric linearity supports continuity in motion state across the missing block.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that function `vf_-7663396197665720575` correctly addresses the missing value problem for the given behavior pattern is 98.04%. This is derived from the proportional weight distribution between the two candidate functions connected to the behavior pattern `vb_-4927443205807001530`. Specifically, the total weight sum is 100 + 2 = 102. The proportion of support for `vf_-7663396197665720575` is therefore 100 / 102 ≈ 0.9804, or 98.04%. This indicates a strong statistical association between this function and the observed kinematic pattern based on historical performance alignment.  \n2. Function `vf_-7663396197665720575` explicitly models linear interpolation using time-proportional scaling of position increments, which aligns with the vessel’s stable speed, consistent COG, and minimal heading fluctuation. It assumes constant-velocity motion along a straight path—precisely matching the described intent of navigating along a fixed route. In contrast, `vf_5240413252068673064`, while functionally similar, has significantly less statistical support (1.96%) and lacks explicit reference to directional consistency in its description, reducing confidence in its contextual precision."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) applicability likely; spatial anchor near Öckerö kommun, Västra Götaland County, Sweden\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel is a cargo ship operating under engine power with no hazardous cargo, typical dimensions, and a draught that allows safe passage in designated fairways. In this coastal region of southwestern Sweden, maritime traffic is often governed by structured routing measures, including TSS zones, to manage vessel flows near busy ports and archipelagos. The observed behavior—stable speed, tightly aligned course over ground and heading, and a linear trajectory—strongly indicates adherence to a predefined route, consistent with autopilot-assisted transit within a regulated corridor. This pattern reflects standard operational practice for commercial vessels navigating open yet controlled waters, where efficiency and collision avoidance are prioritized. Alternative behaviors such as maneuvering, anchoring, or curvilinear navigation do not align with the data, as there is no evidence of speed variation, significant turns, or proximity to port infrastructure requiring dynamic control.\n'''",
