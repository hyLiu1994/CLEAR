      "intent": "navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving south-southeast, approximated by the parametric equations: lat(t) ≈ 54.1658 - 0.0085 × t, lon(t) ≈ 12.1014 + 0.0009 × t, where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
