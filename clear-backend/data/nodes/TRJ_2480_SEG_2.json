    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and operating in the [100, 150) m length and [6, 8) m draught range exhibit stable speed and gradual course change patterns in 83–96% of cases when traversing established shipping lanes such as the Kristiansand–Hirtshals corridor. The pattern associated with vb_82841811344196675 is strongly supported by high-weight edges from key static attributes—particularly navigation_status (w=96), vessel_type (w=83), and draught (w=53)—indicating it is one of the most frequently observed behaviors for this class of vessel in this context. Among all candidate patterns, this movement ranks second highest in cumulative edge weight support from core vessel descriptors, reflecting its prevalence in similar navigational scenarios.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable speed around 14.8–15.0 knots and a consistent, gradual increase in COG from 29.2° to 32.9°, indicating a smooth right turn along a curved maritime route. While the exact speed in vb_82841811344196675 (~10.1–10.2 knots) is lower, its defining characteristics—stable speed profile, gradual and consistent course change, and stable heading—are fully aligned with the behavioral dynamics observed at the boundaries. The intent \"following a curved maritime route\" and the modeled parametric trajectory further match the curvilinear motion implied by the boundary data. Given that local hydrodynamic conditions or traffic separation schemes may cause speed adjustments while preserving steering behavior, this movement best captures the continuity of navigational intent across the gap.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that function `vf_5240413252068673064` can correctly impute the missing segment corresponding to the identified behavior pattern is 98.96%. This is derived from the relative weight distribution between the two candidate functions in the context of the observed behavior pattern. Specifically, the total association weight for the behavior pattern `vb_82841811344196675` is the sum of its connections: 95 (to `vf_5240413252068673064`) + 1 (to `vf_-7663396197665720575`) = 96. The conditional probability of selecting `vf_5240413252068673064` given this behavior pattern is therefore 95 / 96 ≈ 0.9896, or 98.96%. This indicates a strong empirical alignment between this function and the kinematic characteristics of stable-speed, gradually turning vessel motion.  \n2. Function `vf_5240413252068673064` implements time-proportional linear interpolation using normalized time intervals (`t / Time_interval[-1]`), which ensures uniform spacing of interpolated points along the temporal axis. This matches the observed temporal consistency in the AIS data, where position updates occur at regular intervals and speed remains stable. In contrast, while `vf_-7663396197665720575` also performs linear interpolation, it uses `max(Time_interval)` as the normalizing factor—functionally equivalent under monotonic time—but lacks explicit reference to endpoint normalization via `Time_interval[-1]`, making `vf_5240413252068673064` more precise in bounded interval handling."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) applicability: Cargo vessels navigating in the Kristiansand–Hirtshals corridor are required to follow designated shipping lanes, which enforce structured routing to prevent collisions; spatial anchor: nearby established ferry and cargo routes between southern Norway and northern Denmark.\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a stable speed while executing a gradual, consistent turn—is typical for cargo ships transiting curved segments of predefined maritime routes in busy coastal waters. This pattern aligns with standard navigation practices under traffic separation schemes, where vessels adjust course smoothly to stay within lane boundaries while keeping speed constant for fuel efficiency and safety. The observed motion reflects autopilot-assisted tracking of a fixed, gently curving channel rather than free-hand maneuvering or emergency actions. Alternative behaviors such as sharp turns, variable speeds, or erratic headings—which might indicate evasion, docking preparation, or distress—are ruled out by the consistency of speed and heading alignment with course over ground. Given that the route curvature is mild and spans several kilometers, linear interpolation between known points provides a sufficiently accurate and kinematically realistic estimate of missing positions, preserving temporal and spatial continuity without overcomplicating the trajectory model.\n'''",
