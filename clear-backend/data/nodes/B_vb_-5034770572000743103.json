    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel is maintaining a consistent speed, approximately 10.0–10.1 knots, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 48.1° and 50.3°, showing a smooth, controlled progression without abrupt shifts)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 55°–57°, closely aligned with COG, suggesting precise directional control)",
    "Behavior intent: navigating along a fixed route (the vessel is following a predictable, nearly straight trajectory with minor course adjustments typical of open-water or coastal transit)",
    "Duration: 250~300"
