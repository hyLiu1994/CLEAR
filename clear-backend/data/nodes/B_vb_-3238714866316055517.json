    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 3.5 and 4.2 knots over the segment, with minor fluctuations due to hydrodynamic conditions)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly from 213.5° to 211.3°, indicating a smooth, intentional course adjustment over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains tightly clustered around 210°–212°, with only a 2° variation, suggesting precise rudder control)",
    "Behavior intent: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving west-southwest, approximated by the parametric equations:",
