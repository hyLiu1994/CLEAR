    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with lengths between 150–200 meters and draughts in the [8, 10) meter range are observed to follow gently curving maritime routes near shipping lanes in approximately 78% of comparable navigation scenarios. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels maintaining stable speed (weight contribution 96), consistent course adjustments (weight 96), and steady heading control (weight 96), particularly when traversing curved segments of established sea routes. The co-occurrence frequency of this behavior with similar vessel configurations—especially under the same static attributes (vessel_type: Cargo, navigation_status: Under way using engine)—ranks highest among all candidate patterns, indicating it is the most statistically prevalent movement mode for this class of vessel in constrained waterways.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern describes a vessel navigating along a curved maritime route with stable speed, gradual and consistent course change, and minimal heading fluctuation—characteristics directly mirrored in vb_82841811344196675. The parametric trajectory model (lat(t) ≈ 56.150075 + 0.00085 × t + 0.000012 × t², lon(t) ≈ 7.621433 + 0.00035 × t + 0.000008 × t²) aligns spatially and temporally with the expected progression from the preceding and succeeding segments, maintaining a curvature radius consistent with regulated coastal channels. Furthermore, the gap’s incomplete AIS samples show a continuous northeastward progression with increasing latitude and longitude, minor COG variation, and stable SOG around 10 knots—all consistent with the inferred intent of following a predefined curved route, making vb_82841811344196675 the most plausible reconstruction.\n'''"

The stable speed, minimal heading variation, and gradual course adjustment reflect autopilot-assisted navigation along a predefined arc-shaped segment of a maritime traffic lane. This pattern ensures safe separation from other traffic and avoids shallow areas, which is critical given the vessel's draught near 10 meters. Alternative behaviors such as sharp turning or speed fluctuation are inconsistent with standard operating procedures in these zones, while straight-line routing would not match the observed curvature. The continuous northeastward progression under engine power further supports compliant transit within a structured routing system.\n'''",
