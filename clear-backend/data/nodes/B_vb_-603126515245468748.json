  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 7.2 and 9.7 knots with minor fluctuations, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies between 25.4° and 32.7° in small increments, showing a slow, continuous adjustment in direction rather than abrupt turns)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains tightly clustered around 36° ± 2°, suggesting the vessel is not making erratic rudder movements and is likely following an autopilot-guided path)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
