  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving west-southwest, approximated by the parametric equations: lat(t) ≈ 57.7877 - 0.0045 × t, lon(t) ≈ 10.1232 - 0.0180 × t, where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 15.4–15.6 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 239.8° and 242.7°, showing a smooth, progressive change over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: gradual and consistent (heading remains fixed at 236.0° throughout, indicating stable rudder control despite small COG shifts)",
