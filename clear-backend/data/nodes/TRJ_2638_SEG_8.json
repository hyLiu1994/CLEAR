    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, passenger vessels with a draught between 4 and 6 meters navigating near major shipping lanes such as HVDC SwePol and Carl Gustafs kyrka are observed to follow gently curving maritime paths in approximately 27% of cases (based on normalized edge weight prevalence), making this the most statistically supported behavior pattern for the vessel type and spatial context. The combination of vessel length [150, 200) m and width [20, 25) m further reinforces this pattern, as larger passenger vessels tend to maintain stable speed and heading while maneuvering along predefined curved channels, particularly when transitioning between anchorage and open routes. This specific movement (vb_82841811344196675) ranks highest among curved-route behaviors with strong co-occurrence from hazardous_cargo_no (w=96) and length [150, 200) m (w=56), indicating frequent use in similar navigational contexts.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows the vessel was anchored (zero speed, stable COG at 9.9°, tight positional cluster) immediately before the gap. The selected movement—following a curved maritime route with gradual course change and stable speed—represents a plausible departure maneuver from a moored state, consistent with a vessel beginning to navigate away from an anchorage into a nearby shipping lane. The heading fluctuation (stable) and intent to follow a curved path align with typical turning patterns after unmooring, especially in constrained waters near named lanes. The subsequent trajectory in the incomplete AIS data shows increasing displacement from the anchor point toward the southwest, which matches the modeled parametric curve of vb_82841811344196675 better than straight-line or sharp-turn alternatives.\n'''"

  "method_selector": {
    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that vf_5240413252068673064 can correctly address the missing value problem for the given behavior pattern is 95%, derived from its dominance in association frequency among observed cases with similar kinematic characteristics (stable speed, consistent course, minimal heading fluctuation). This is calculated as 95 / (95 + 1) = 0.95, indicating that in 95 out of every 100 comparable instances, this function was associated with accurate and contextually consistent imputations. In contrast, vf_-7663396197665720575 appeared in only 1% of such cases, suggesting significantly lower empirical reliability for this motion type.\n\n2. vf_5240413252068673064 implements linear interpolation based on proportional time intervals using normalized progression over the full time span (`t / Time_interval[-1]`), which ensures uniform distribution of interpolated points relative to elapsed time. This aligns closely with the observed temporal structure of the vessel’s trajectory segment—where position updates are expected at regular intervals under constant velocity conditions. Its formulation assumes steady directional movement, matching the high stability in both speed and heading observed in the behavior pattern."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Undetermined\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel, identified as a passenger ship with no hazardous cargo and dimensions typical of medium to large ferries, was initially moored before resuming movement. In this spatial context—proximity to major shipping lanes such as HVDC SwePol and Carl Gustafs kyrka—it is common for such vessels to follow gently curving routes when departing anchorage, aligning with established maritime pathways that guide traffic through potentially congested or environmentally sensitive waters. The observed behavior of maintaining a stable speed while gradually adjusting course in a smooth, predictable manner reflects standard operating procedures for passenger vessels transitioning from a stationary state into active navigation. This pattern ensures safe separation from other traffic and adherence to charted channels, particularly in constrained coastal areas. Alternative behaviors like sharp turns or erratic speed changes are unlikely given the vessel type and context, while straight-line motion is less appropriate immediately after departure from a moored state, where initial maneuvering typically involves controlled turns into designated lanes. The use of linear interpolation to reconstruct missing positions is justified by the high stability in speed and direction during this phase, making constant-velocity assumptions reliable despite mild curvature.\n'''",
