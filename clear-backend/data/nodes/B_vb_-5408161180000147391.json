  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation: lat(t) ≈ 54.3466 + 0.0001 × t - 0.00004 × t², lon(t) ≈ 9.9120 + 0.0042 × t + 0.0003 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 6.0 and 6.7 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes smoothly from ~118° to ~73°, then increases to ~74°, indicating a continuous, controlled turn)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains closely aligned with COG throughout, varying only slightly within ±5°, suggesting steady helm control)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation: lat(t) ≈ 54.3466 + 0.0001 × t - 0.00004 × t², lon(t) ≈ 9.9120 + 0.0042 × t + 0.0003 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
