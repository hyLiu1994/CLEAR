    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and dimensions between 150–200 m in length and 20–25 m in width are strongly associated with this behavior pattern, appearing in 84% of similar navigational contexts. The vessel's location near major Baltic shipping lanes—particularly the Travemünde–Helsinki corridor—further reinforces this pattern, as it aligns with typical transit behaviors on curved segments of designated routes. Among all candidate patterns, this movement has the highest cumulative edge weight (129) from key static attributes, especially navigation status and vessel type, indicating it is the most frequently observed behavior for this class of vessel under these conditions.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable speed around 16.5 knots, gradual course evolution from 60.5° to 61.0°, and constant heading at 59.0°, indicating steady-state navigation along a gently curved maritime route. While the candidate movement (vb_8377157303611993086) operates at a lower speed (~10.1–10.2 knots), it shares identical qualitative characteristics: stable speed profile, stable heading, and gradual COG adjustment consistent with curvature. Given that speed can vary due to operational or environmental factors while behavioral intent remains consistent, the continuity in *course_change* dynamics and *intent*—navigating a predefined curved route—makes this the most plausible match. The gap’s geographic progression (northeasterly trajectory with slight curvature) also aligns spatially with the modeled polynomial path of this pattern.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the observed behavior pattern is 92.8%. This is derived from the proportion of successfully imputed trajectories in historical datasets exhibiting similar kinematic characteristics (stable speed, gradual course change, and consistent heading). Among 145 recorded trajectory segments with matching dynamic profiles (speed_profile: stable, course_change: gradual, heading_fluctuation: stable), 135 were accurately reconstructed using linear interpolation with negligible positional error (<50 meters RMS), yielding a success rate of 135/145 ≈ 0.928.  \n2. The function exhibits high consistency with the current context, as it assumes uniform motion along a near-linear path—precisely matching the vessel’s observed behavior. Over the sampled segment, latitude increases from 55.4915° to 55.5091° and longitude from 15.0517° to 15.1080°, forming a progression with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.998 between time and position components, indicating strong linearity. Additionally, the average speed across the segment varies only between 10.1 and 10.3 knots (std = 0.08 knots), and COG changes by less than 2° over 40 observations, supporting the assumption of constant-velocity motion required by the function."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "IMO COLREGs Rule 8 (Action to Avoid Collision) - Applicable in congested shipping lanes; spatial anchor near Baltic Sea transit corridors\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a steady speed with minimal heading variation and smoothly adjusting its course—is typical for cargo vessels navigating designated maritime routes where traffic density and navigational constraints require predictable motion. Given its location near major Baltic shipping lanes, such as the route between Travemünde and Helsinki, vessels are expected to follow predefined curved paths to maintain safe separation and alignment with traffic flow. This pattern rules out anchoring, maneuvering, or erratic motion, which would show in speed fluctuations or sharp course changes. Instead, the consistent heading and gradual COG evolution reflect adherence to standardized routing measures, ensuring safe and efficient passage through shared waterways. The use of linear interpolation for gap filling is justified because, over short segments, the path closely approximates a straight line despite slight curvature at larger scales, and historical data confirms this method reliably reconstructs positions under such stable conditions.\n'''",
