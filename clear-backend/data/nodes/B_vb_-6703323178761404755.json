  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (the combination of zero SOG, repeated identical latitude/longitude pairs, and varying COG with stable heading indicates the vessel is not under way but likely swinging at anchor or moored; position can be imputed as fixed: latitude ≈ 54.4235 ± 0.0002, longitude ≈ 13.6729 ± 0.0003, forming a tight cluster with radius < 20 meters)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a near-zero speed across multiple observations, indicating no significant movement)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (the COG varies significantly between readings, from 57.3° to over 250°, despite lack of motion, suggesting inconsistent reference points or sensor noise while stationary)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (despite changes in COG, the heading remains within a narrow range around 200–230°, indicating the vessel is not maneuvering but may be swinging at anchor)",
    "Behavior intent: anchored or moored in a confined area (the combination of zero SOG, repeated identical latitude/longitude pairs, and varying COG with stable heading indicates the vessel is not under way but likely swinging at anchor or moored; position can be imputed as fixed: latitude ≈ 54.4235 ± 0.0002, longitude ≈ 13.6729 ± 0.0003, forming a tight cluster with radius < 20 meters)",
