    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 10.7 and 14.6 knots with gradual increase, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly from ~182° to ~149° over time, showing a smooth, continuous turn rather than abrupt maneuvers)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains tightly clustered around 181–150° with minimal oscillation, suggesting controlled steering)",
