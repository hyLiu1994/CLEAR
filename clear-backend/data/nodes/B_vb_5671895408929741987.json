  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving west-southwest, approximated by the parametric equations: lat(t) ≈ 54.943 - 0.0012 × t, lon(t) ≈ 13.5047 - 0.0081 × t, where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 13.4 and 13.9 knots with minimal variation, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG remains tightly clustered around 250–251°, with only minor adjustments over time, suggesting smooth directional control)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading fluctuates slightly between 251° and 252°, remaining closely aligned with COG, indicating stable rudder control and no erratic yawing)",
    "Behavior intent: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving west-southwest, approximated by the parametric equations: lat(t) ≈ 54.943 - 0.0012 × t, lon(t) ≈ 13.5047 - 0.0081 × t, where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
