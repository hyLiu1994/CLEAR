    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed, with SOG values consistently around 7.7–8.1 knots over multiple observations)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly from 216.1° to 224.4°, then back to 219.2°, indicating a smooth, intentional turn or route curvature rather than erratic movement)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 216°–232°, showing controlled directional stability despite minor course adjustments)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, consistent heading, and gradual COG change suggests the vessel is navigating along a predefined curved channel or coastal bend, likely aligning with charted waterways in this latitude/longitude region)",
