    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 10.2 and 10.5 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slowly between 353.8° and 358.4°, indicating a smooth, continuous adjustment in direction over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains nearly constant at 2–3°, suggesting the vessel is not making abrupt turns)",
