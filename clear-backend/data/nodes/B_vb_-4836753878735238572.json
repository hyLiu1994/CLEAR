  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (the combination of zero speed, stable COG, and steady heading, along with small positional fluctuations within a ~50-meter radius around latitude 55.71133 and longitude 12.60230, indicates the vessel is not underway but maintaining position, likely due to anchoring or mooring; the position scatter forms a tight cluster approximating a small circular area with radius ~20 meters, modeled by: lat(t) ≈ 55.71133 + 0.00002 × sin(2πt), lon(t) ≈ 12.60230 + 0.00002 × cos(2πt), where t ∈ [0,1] represents normalized time over the observation period)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains zero speed across all observations, indicating no movement)",
    "Course change: stable (COG remains constant at 297.7° despite lack of motion, suggesting the vessel is not altering its intended direction)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains around 110.0° with minimal variation, consistent with a fixed orientation while stationary)",
