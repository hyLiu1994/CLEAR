    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, passenger vessels 'under way using engine' with draughts in [4, 6) m and dimensions in the [150, 200) m length and [25, 30) m width range are strongly associated with straight-route navigation patterns. This particular behavior pattern (vb_-4927443205807001530) is highly prevalent among such vessels, supported by strong edge weights: navigation_status contributes 102 out of 502 total edges (20.3%), hazardous_cargo_no accounts for 102/502 (20.3%), vessel_type_Passenger contributes 16/502 (3.2%), draught_[4,6) m adds 27/502 (5.4%), length_[150,200) m provides 63/502 (12.6%), and width_[25,30) m contributes 43/502 (8.6%). Aggregated across all static attributes, this movement ranks second in total support (250 cumulative weight), indicating it is a commonly observed behavior for this class of vessel under similar operational conditions. Notably, the absence of spatial context linkage does not diminish confidence, as the vessel’s intent aligns with open-water route following rather than port maneuvering or lane switching.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable speed (~15.6–15.7 knots), consistent COG (63.0°–63.7°), constant heading (63.0°), and a linear eastward trajectory with slight northerly drift—indicative of steady progress along a fixed maritime route. While the candidate movement vb_-4927443205807001530 involves a slightly different direction (northeast-bound), it shares the core characteristics: stable speed, gradual and consistent course, stable heading, and clear intent to follow a predefined linear path. The gap's incomplete AIS samples show progressive eastward and slight northward movement consistent with sustained directional travel. Although speed differs slightly, the overall behavioral signature—especially the alignment of COG and heading, minimal fluctuation, and lack of erratic course changes—strongly supports continuity with a fixed-route navigation pattern. Thus, vb_-4927443205807001530 best matches the expected behavior given both the vessel’s static attributes and the kinematic consistency across the gap boundaries.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that vf_-7663396197665720575 correctly addresses the missing value problem given the observed behavior pattern is 98.04%. This is derived from the relative weight distribution between the two candidate functions connected to the behavior pattern vb_-4927443205807001530, where vf_-7663396197665720575 has a weight of 100 and vf_5240413252068673064 has a weight of 2. The conditional probability is calculated as P(f₁|b) = w₁ / (w₁ + w₂) = 100 / (100 + 2) ≈ 0.9804, or 98.04%. This indicates strong empirical or historical reliability of f₁ in handling this specific kinematic context.  \n2. The function vf_-7663396197665720575 implements time-proportional linear interpolation using max(Time_interval) as the normalizing factor, ensuring precise alignment with the temporal progression of the vessel’s motion. It explicitly accounts for stable speed and consistent course over ground (COG), which matches the observed trajectory's characteristics—specifically, the near-linear northeastward movement with minimal heading fluctuation. In contrast, the alternative function, while similar, uses Time_interval[-1] for normalization, which may introduce minor discrepancies if the interval is not uniformly sampled or if timing irregularities exist. Given the high stability in speed and heading, the more robust scaling method in vf_-7663396197665720575 ensures superior consistency with the actual vessel dynamics."

The observed stable speed, consistent course over ground, and minimal heading variation indicate the vessel is operating under autopilot along a fixed route, which is standard practice in open-water segments of busy shipping lanes. This behavior aligns with international collision avoidance guidelines requiring predictable motion in congested zones. Alternative behaviors such as maneuvering near port or navigating curved channels are less likely given the lack of significant course changes and the vessel’s position relative to known coastal bends or terminal areas.\n'''",
