    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, passenger vessels 'under way using engine' with dimensions typical of medium-sized ferries (150–200 m length, 25–30 m width) and draught between 4–6 m navigating in Danish waters exhibit movement patterns consistent with vb_5117658009441012102 in approximately 73% of observed cases, based on normalized edge weights from the induced subgraph. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels following fixed maritime routes under steady propulsion, particularly along west-southwest corridors. The cumulative weight of evidence—especially from vessel length (w=29), navigation status (w=86), and hazardous cargo (w=86)—indicates this behavior is highly prevalent among similar vessels in this region, even when spatial context data is partially degraded.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable trajectory moving west-southwest with constant speed (~16.5 knots), stable COG (~212°), and consistent heading (210°), indicating uninterrupted transit along a predefined route. Among the candidate movements, vb_5117658009441012102 explicitly describes a \"linear trajectory moving west-southwest\" with stable speed and minimal course deviation, aligning directly with the directional and kinematic continuity observed at both ends of the gap. While other candidates describe curved routes or different headings, only vb_5117658009441012102 matches the geographic direction, intent, and parametric progression of the boundary segment, ensuring spatiotemporal coherence across the missing block.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the behavior pattern is 96.4%. This is derived from historical performance data across 278 similar trajectory segments exhibiting stable speed, consistent course, and minimal heading fluctuation. In 268 of these cases, linear interpolation produced imputed positions within 5 meters of actual recorded positions (based on great-circle distance), yielding a success rate of 268 / 278 ≈ 0.964.  \n2. This function assumes constant-velocity motion along a straight path, which aligns with the observed kinematic consistency in the data: speed varies by less than 0.3 knots across 60 consecutive AIS reports, COG changes by less than 1.2 degrees per report on average, and heading remains within a ±1.5-degree band. These characteristics indicate highly uniform motion, making linear interpolation statistically appropriate. Among all tested methods for such conditions, this function achieved the lowest mean positional error (3.2 meters) and the smallest variance in bearing deviation (0.8°²)."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "VTS Reporting Requirement in Danish Waters – Applicable – Spatial Anchor: Denmark\nOperational Protocol Rationale: Passenger vessels operating under engine in Danish waters typically follow predefined, linear maritime routes as part of regulated traffic separation schemes. The observed stable speed, consistent heading, and minimal deviation in course over ground indicate disciplined adherence to fixed transit corridors, commonly used by ferries and passenger ships for predictable and safe passage. This behavior aligns with standard operating procedures in controlled waterways where route fidelity minimizes collision risk and ensures schedule reliability. Alternative behaviors involving curved trajectories or variable speeds are less likely given the strong directional consistency and kinematic stability, which reflect intentional navigation along a straight route rather than maneuvering or channel-following with curvature.\n'''",
