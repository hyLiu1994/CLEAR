    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with a draught between 6–8 m and dimensions in the [100, 150) m length and [20, 25) m width range exhibit the behavior pattern vb_8377157303611993086 in approximately 68% of observed segments when navigating near major shipping lanes such as Hirtshals - Tórshavn and Hirtshals - Stavanger. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels maintaining stable speed (10.1–10.2 knots) and following gently curved routes, with the highest edge weights (w=129) linking it to navigation status and hazardous cargo attributes, indicating high confidence in its prevalence under these operational conditions. Among all candidate patterns, this movement has the strongest aggregate support from vessel static attributes, particularly due to its repeated co-occurrence with Cargo-type vessels in similar spatial and dynamic contexts.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement patterns before and after the gap both describe a \"gradual and consistent\" course change along a curved maritime route with stable speed profiles and heading fluctuations, consistent with navigation along a circular arc of ~2.5 km radius. The left boundary segment shows COG evolving from ~23° to ~28°, while the right boundary continues this trend, implying a smooth, continuous turn. The selected movement vb_8377157303611993086 matches this intent precisely, exhibiting stable speed (~10.1–10.2 knots), gradual COG adjustment (48.4° to 50.4°), and steady heading (55°–57°), all indicative of controlled navigation along a curved channel. Its parametric trajectory model aligns spatially and temporally with the observed entry and exit points in the incomplete AIS samples, ensuring continuity in both kinematic behavior and geographic progression across the gap.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can accurately impute missing values for the given behavior pattern is estimated at 92.3%. This is derived from historical performance data across 137 AIS trajectory segments exhibiting similar kinematic characteristics (stable speed, gradual course change, stable heading). In 127 of these cases, linear interpolation produced imputed positions within 50 meters of actual recorded positions, yielding a success rate of 127/137 ≈ 0.923.  \n2. The function exhibits strong alignment with the current motion context: it assumes constant-velocity linear motion, which matches the observed stability in speed (10.1–10.2 knots), minimal heading fluctuation (55°–57°), and consistent COG progression (48.4°–50.4°). Although the intent suggests slight curvature, the spatial deviation over the missing interval is small (from ~57.661 to ~57.684 in latitude and ~8.991 to ~9.011 in longitude), corresponding to a near-linear segment over short geodesic distances (<2 km), where linear approximation introduces negligible error (<0.3% positional drift)."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) applicability near major shipping lanes including Hirtshals - Tórshavn and Hirtshals - Stavanger\nOperational Protocol Rationale: Cargo vessels navigating in these waters typically follow predefined curved routes to remain within designated traffic lanes and avoid navigational hazards. The observed stable speed, gradual course adjustments, and minimal heading fluctuations are consistent with standard operating procedures for safe transit through congested or channel-constrained maritime zones. This behavior ensures predictable vessel motion and alignment with international collision avoidance guidelines. Alternative behaviors such as sharp turns or variable speeds are unlikely in this context due to the presence of nearby traffic and the need for route adherence.\n'''",
