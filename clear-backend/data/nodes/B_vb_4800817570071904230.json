  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving south-southeast, approximated by the parametric equations: lat(t) ≈ 54.1658 - 0.0085 × t, lon(t) ≈ 12.1014 + 0.0009 × t, where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 6.7 and 6.8 knots over the initial segment, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases slowly from 161.1° to 164.0°, then more significantly to 196.9°–201.4°, showing a continuous turn to the south)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (despite course changes, heading remains closely aligned with COG, varying only slightly around 162°–358°, suggesting controlled rudder input without oscillation)",
    "Behavior intent: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving south-southeast, approximated by the parametric equations: lat(t) ≈ 54.1658 - 0.0085 × t, lon(t) ≈ 12.1014 + 0.0009 × t, where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
