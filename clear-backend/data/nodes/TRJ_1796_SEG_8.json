    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, passenger vessels 'under way using engine' operating in coastal waters of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany—particularly within busy shipping lanes such as the TSS South of Gedser and routes connecting Travemünde to Malmö, Trelleborg, and Helsinki—frequently exhibit movement patterns characterized by stable speed, gradual course changes, and steady heading control. This specific behavior pattern (vb_8377157303611993086) is strongly associated with these vessels, evidenced by high edge weights: 129/129 (100%) for navigation status, 129/129 (100%) for hazardous cargo (absence), and 99/99 (100%) for vessel length matching [150, 200) m. The spatial context further reinforces this selection, as the observed curved route aligns with known navigational channels in the Baltic Sea coastal zone where gentle turns are required to follow designated traffic separation schemes. Among all candidate patterns, this one shows the highest combined support from static attributes, especially for passenger ships maintaining predictable trajectories under engine power.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern indicates a vessel navigating along a fixed, linear eastward trajectory with stable speed, consistent heading, and minimal course deviation—indicative of open-water transit along a predefined route. The selected movement (vb_8377157303611993086) maintains consistency in key behavioral dimensions: speed_profile (stable), course_change (gradual and consistent), and heading_fluctuation (stable), ensuring smooth continuity across the gap. Although the intent shifts slightly from \"fixed route\" to \"curved maritime route,\" this transition is plausible given the vessel’s progression through a coastal region requiring minor directional adjustments while preserving overall momentum and alignment with traffic flow. The parametric trajectory model (Δlat ≈ k·Δlong with slight curvature) bridges the linear trend before and after the gap, accommodating natural routing geometry without abrupt behavioral shifts.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the identified behavior pattern is 92.3%. This is derived from historical performance data across 13 similar trajectory segments exhibiting stable speed, gradual course change, and consistent heading. In 12 out of these 13 cases (12/13 ≈ 0.923), linear interpolation produced imputed coordinates within 5 meters of actual recorded positions, meeting operational accuracy thresholds for maritime movement imputation under steady-state navigation conditions.  \n2. The function exhibits strong alignment with the current kinematic context: it assumes constant velocity motion along a straight-line path between known endpoints, which matches the observed stability in speed (10.1–10.2 knots), minimal heading fluctuation (55°–57°), and gradual COG adjustment (48.4°–50.4°). Although the intent suggests slight curvature, the local progression (Δlat ≈ k·Δlong, k ≈ 0.7–0.8) over the short segment indicates near-linear spatial evolution, making linear interpolation both computationally efficient and geometrically accurate within acceptable error bounds."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) compliance required; applicable to passenger vessels in coastal waters of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany; spatial anchor: TSS South of Gedser and adjacent shipping lanes\nOperational Protocol Rationale: Passenger vessels operating in this region typically follow structured maritime routes to maintain safe separation in busy traffic zones. The observed behavior—stable speed, gradual course adjustments, and consistent heading—aligns with standard navigation practices within designated shipping lanes, where vessels must execute smooth, predictable maneuvers to comply with traffic flow. This pattern is especially common along curved segments of established routes, such as those connecting Travemünde to Malmö or Trelleborg, where minor directional changes are required while preserving steady progress. The absence of abrupt turns or speed variations rules out anchoring, maneuvering, or port-hugging behaviors, confirming that the vessel is engaged in routine transit under engine power within a regulated corridor.\n'''",
