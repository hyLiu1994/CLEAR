  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed, with SOG varying only slightly from 6.3 to 6.7 knots, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly and coherently from ~118° to ~121°, then stabilizes around 118–120°, suggesting controlled navigation along a curved path)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 120°–122°, with minimal deviation, indicating stable rudder control)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
