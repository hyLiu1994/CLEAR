  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial: lat(t) ≈ 54.3601 + 0.0075 × t - 0.0002 × t², lon(t) ≈ 10.0226 + 0.1085 × t + 0.0006 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed, with SOG decreasing only slightly from 6.7 to 1.6 knots over an extended period, indicating controlled movement rather than stopping)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes steadily from ~73.7° to ~106.6°, increasing at a smooth rate over time, suggesting a planned turn)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains tightly clustered around 100–103° after initial adjustment, with minimal variation despite COG drift, indicating stabilized directional control)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial: lat(t) ≈ 54.3601 + 0.0075 × t - 0.0002 × t², lon(t) ≈ 10.0226 + 0.1085 × t + 0.0006 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
