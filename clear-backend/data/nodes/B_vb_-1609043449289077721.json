  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation: lat(t) ≈ 54.3556 - 0.0022 × t + 0.00015 × t², lon(t) ≈ 9.7774 - 0.0048 × t + 0.00025 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 5.9 and 6.6 knots with minimal variation, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slowly from 228.7° to 231.1° over the sequence, showing a smooth evolution in direction without abrupt changes)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains tightly clustered around 229°±1°, indicating precise rudder control and no erratic yawing)",
