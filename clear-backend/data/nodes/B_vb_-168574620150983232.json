  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of 16.6–16.2 knots with minimal variation, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 89.2° and 90.5°, showing a smooth, sustained eastward orientation with minor adjustments)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains almost constant at 91.0° or 90.0°, with deviations ≤1°, indicating precise rudder control and no abrupt turns)",
    "Behavior intent: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving east-southeast, approximated by the parametric equations:",
