  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (the combination of near-zero speed, large COG fluctuations, and stable heading indicates the vessel is not under way but rotating slightly at anchor or moored; position remains tightly clustered around latitude ~54.42365°, longitude ~13.6692°, with deviations less than 0.0006°, forming a stationary pattern best modeled as a point cluster: lat ≈ 54.42365 ± 0.00005, lon ≈ 13.6692 ± 0.0004)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a speed of 0.0–0.1 knots across multiple observations, indicating minimal movement)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (COG varies significantly between 78.1° and 313.6°, even while speed is near zero, suggesting no consistent directional progression)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (despite changes in COG, heading remains within a narrow range of 130°–190°, indicating the vessel’s bow orientation is relatively fixed)",
    "Behavior intent: anchored or moored in a confined area (the combination of near-zero speed, large COG fluctuations, and stable heading indicates the vessel is not under way but rotating slightly at anchor or moored; position remains tightly clustered around latitude ~54.42365°, longitude ~13.6692°, with deviations less than 0.0006°, forming a stationary pattern best modeled as a point cluster: lat ≈ 54.42365 ± 0.00005, lon ≈ 13.6692 ± 0.0004)",
