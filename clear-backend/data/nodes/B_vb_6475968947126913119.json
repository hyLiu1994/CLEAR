  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 15.0–15.8 knots across consecutive observations, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slightly but persistently, e.g., from 63.1° to 238.1° over time, with long segments showing stable COG around 63.1° and then a sustained shift to ~238°, suggesting progression along a predefined route with a major turn)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains fixed at 62.0° or 236.0° throughout each segment, with minimal variation, indicating controlled navigation without erratic yawing)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
