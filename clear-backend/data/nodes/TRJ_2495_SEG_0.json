    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and dimensions typical of medium-sized freighters (100–150 m length, 20–25 m width) are observed to follow gently curving maritime routes near established shipping lanes such as the København–Oslo corridor in approximately 78% of comparable trajectory gaps. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels maintaining stable speed and gradual course adjustments, with edge weights indicating high co-occurrence between the vessel’s static attributes and curved-route behavior (e.g., vs_vessel_type_Cargo → vb_82841811344196675 at w=83, vs_navigation_status_Under way using engine → vb_82841811344196675 at w=96). The cumulative evidence from the induced subgraph shows this movement is the most statistically prevalent among those aligned with both vessel characteristics and spatial context.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable speed of ~13.5 knots, a slowly evolving COG between 299.7° and 301.1°, and a fixed heading of 300.0°, indicating navigation along a smooth, curved route—consistent with the intent described in vb_82841811344196675. The parametric trajectory model of this candidate (lat(t) ≈ 56.150075 + 0.00085 × t + 0.000012 × t², lon(t) ≈ 7.621433 + 0.00035 × t + 0.000008 × t²) reflects a similar curvature and spatiotemporal progression as the observed boundary segment, which also follows a circular arc of ~2.5 km radius. Given the continuity in speed stability, heading alignment, and curvilinear intent, vb_82841811344196675 best bridges the gap while preserving behavioral coherence across adjacent segments.\n'''"

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Route Adherence in Designated Shipping Lanes (applicable to cargo vessels navigating near established maritime corridors; spatial anchor: København–Oslo shipping route)\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a stable speed, following a smooth curvilinear path with gradual course adjustments, and showing minimal heading variation—is consistent with standard navigation practices along predefined curved segments of major shipping lanes. This pattern reflects autopilot-assisted transit under normal operating conditions, where vessels align with charted routes to ensure safe separation from traffic and navigational hazards. The observed trajectory curvature matches the expected geometry of regulated channel bends in coastal or high-traffic zones. Alternative behaviors such as sharp maneuvering, speed fluctuations, or straight-line routing are inconsistent with both the spatial context and the vessel’s steady control parameters, further supporting that this is a controlled transit along an engineered maritime pathway.\n'''",
