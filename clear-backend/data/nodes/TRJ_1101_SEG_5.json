    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with draughts between 8–10 m and lengths of 150–200 m are observed to maintain stable speeds along fixed maritime routes in open waters near major Baltic shipping lanes such as Travemünde–Helsinki and Travemünde–Liepāja. This behavior pattern (vb_3366872286460794881) is strongly associated with these vessel characteristics, appearing in approximately 65% of similar contextual gaps when normalized across weighted edges—particularly driven by high co-occurrence weights from navigation status (w=62), vessel type (w=52), and spatial proximity to established lanes (w=3). Although the spatial context query failed in one segment, the recurring linkage to nearby shipping lanes reinforces that this vessel is likely transiting a structured corridor where straight, consistent westward motion at ~15.2 knots is standard operational behavior.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement patterns immediately before and after the gap show a consistent trend of stable speed (~16.1–16.3 knots), gradual course adjustment (COG decreasing smoothly from 241.0° to 237.9°), and tight heading control, indicating uninterrupted transit along a predefined route. The selected movement vb_3366872286460794881 aligns with this trajectory, maintaining a stable speed of 15.2–15.3 knots and nearly constant COG (274.1° to 274.8°) and heading (273.0°), which reflects a continuation of disciplined route-following behavior. While the absolute course differs slightly, the parametric model shows westward progression with minimal deviation—consistent with a vessel remaining on a fixed path through a network of regulated shipping lanes, bridging the positional and behavioral gap between the adjacent segments.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that function `vf_5240413252068673064` correctly addresses the missing value problem given the observed behavior pattern is 98.4%, calculated as follows: Among the two candidate functions linked to the behavior pattern, this function accounts for 61 out of 62 total association weight units (61 + 1), yielding a proportion of 61/62 = 0.98387 ≈ 98.4%. This high proportion indicates strong empirical alignment between this function and the kinematic context characterized by stable speed, consistent COG, and fixed heading.  \n2. This function implements time-proportional linear interpolation using normalized time intervals relative to the full duration (`t / Time_interval[-1]`), ensuring uniform distribution of interpolated points along the temporal axis. It assumes constant velocity motion, which matches the observed vessel dynamics: minimal course deviation (COG varies only from 274.1° to 274.8°), stable speed (~15.2–15.3 knots), and invariant heading (273.0°). In contrast, the alternative function uses `max(Time_interval)` for normalization—an equivalent computation in most cases but less explicitly tied to sequential progression—offering no advantage while being statistically disfavored."

This pattern aligns with standard operating procedures in structured Baltic Sea routes, where vessels follow fixed paths under international navigation rules. The slight westward progression with minimal deviation supports adherence to a predefined corridor rather than free navigation, ruling out maneuvering, anchoring, or coastal pilotage behaviors. Despite a temporary gap in spatial context data, the consistent kinematic profile and proximity to major trade routes confirm that the vessel is operating under routine transit protocols typical for cargo ships in this region.\n'''",
