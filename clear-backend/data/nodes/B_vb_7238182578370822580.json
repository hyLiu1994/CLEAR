    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed with gradual increase from 1.2 to 7.3 knots, indicating steady propulsion without abrupt changes)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG evolves slowly from ~114° to ~93.5°, then shifts more significantly to ~53.6°, indicating a planned, smooth trajectory adjustment over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains close to 102° for most of the segment, with only minor deviations, suggesting controlled steering)",
