    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 7.7 and 10.1 knots with minimal fluctuation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases slowly and consistently from 36.3° to 51.4°, indicating a smooth turn to the right)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading varies only slightly between 33.0° and 51.0°, remaining closely aligned with COG)",
