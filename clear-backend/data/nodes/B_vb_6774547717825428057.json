  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial: lat(t) ≈ 54.3391 - 0.0255 × t + 0.0008 × t², lon(t) ≈ 13.8324 - 0.0218 × t - 0.0003 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed moving segment)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed of approximately 5.0 knots in the initial moving segment, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes from 200.6° to 224.9° over successive positions, showing a smooth turn to the south-southeast)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading varies slightly between 205° and 226°, remaining closely aligned with COG, suggesting controlled steering without oscillation)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial: lat(t) ≈ 54.3391 - 0.0255 × t + 0.0008 × t², lon(t) ≈ 13.8324 - 0.0218 × t - 0.0003 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed moving segment)",
