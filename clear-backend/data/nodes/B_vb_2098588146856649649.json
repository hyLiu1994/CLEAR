  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the vessel progresses northeastward in a smooth arc, as indicated by the coordinated increase in both latitude and longitude paired with gradual COG changes; this is typical of vessels navigating along predefined curved shipping lanes or rounding a coastal feature)",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a relatively consistent speed between 7.0 and 10.7 knots, with minor fluctuations around an average of ~9 knots)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slowly from 25.5° to 33.2°, showing a smooth progression without abrupt shifts, indicating steady course adjustment)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains consistently between 35° and 38°, fluctuating only slightly around 36°, suggesting controlled navigation)",
