    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' navigating near unnamed traffic separation schemes exhibit the \"following a curved maritime route\" behavior in 83% of cases when vessel length is between 50–100 meters and width is 10–15 meters. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels of similar draught ([2,4) m), where stable speed and gradual course changes are observed in tightly controlled channel environments. The high edge weight (w=83) from vessel_type_Cargo to this movement indicates it is one of the most frequently observed behaviors for this class of vessel in constrained waterways, particularly when aligned with predefined curved routes.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement patterns both describe a \"gradual and consistent\" course change along a curved route with stable speed (6.0–7.4 knots and 6.8–7.2 knots respectively) and minimal heading fluctuation, closely matching the characteristics of vb_82841811344196675, which also reflects a stable-speed, gradually turning vessel on a predefined arc. Although the speed in the candidate is slightly higher (implied by model trajectory), the overall intent—navigating a gentle curve with autopilot-like precision—aligns seamlessly with the transition between the pre- and post-gap segments. Additionally, the duration (200~250) fits within the expected range bridging the adjacent segments (300~350 and 350~400), making it a temporally plausible interpolation.\n'''"

This pattern aligns with standard operating procedures for cargo vessels transiting constrained channels or coastal bends under autopilot control, where minimal heading fluctuations and steady propulsion reflect compliance with routing measures. The observed intent to follow a curved maritime route closely matches the expected behavior in a TSS environment, as opposed to open-sea maneuvers or anchoring patterns, which would exhibit different speed and course dynamics.\n'''",
