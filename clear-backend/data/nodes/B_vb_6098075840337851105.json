    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 7.2 and 9.3 knots with minor fluctuations, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slowly between 23.7° and 33.1°, showing a smooth directional shift over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains tightly clustered between 35° and 38°, suggesting minimal rudder activity and stable steering)",
