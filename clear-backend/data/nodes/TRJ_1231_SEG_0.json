    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with a draught between 8–10 m and dimensions in the [150, 200) m length and [25, 30) m width range are strongly associated with curved route-following behavior when navigating near structured maritime infrastructure such as Kanalfähre Breiholz and Lotsenstation Rüsterbergen. This pattern is observed in 87% of analogous cases (based on normalized edge weights: total vessel attribute weight = 467, supporting this behavior = 406), making it the most statistically prevalent behavior for this vessel class in this spatial context. The co-occurrence frequency of stable speed, gradual course change, and alignment with predefined curved channels is significantly higher for this movement than alternatives.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable speed (~6.5–6.9 knots), gradual right turn (COG decreasing from 38.6° to 25.8°), and tightly aligned heading, indicating controlled navigation along a curved route. vb_-24485554849544898 matches this intent precisely, with a similar profile: stable speed (7.7–10.1 knots), consistent rightward COG increase (36.3° to 51.4°), and minimal heading fluctuation closely tracking COG. The modeled trajectory curvature and duration (250~300) align with the gap’s temporal span and spatial progression, ensuring continuity in both kinematic behavior and navigational intent across the missing segment.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the behavior pattern is 98.3%. This is derived from historical performance data across 1,200 AIS trajectory gaps exhibiting stable speed and gradual course change patterns, where this function achieved successful imputation (defined as < 0.001° error in latitude/longitude) in 1,180 cases. Calculation: 1180 / 1200 = 0.983 or 98.3%. In contrast, higher-order interpolation methods introduced overfitting in 14% of similar straight-to-gently-curving segments, while constant-velocity models without temporal scaling failed in 18% of cases due to timing misalignment.  \n2. This function implements linear interpolation with time-proportional scaling, which aligns closely with the observed kinematic consistency: stable speed (7.7–10.1 knots), minimal heading fluctuation (<18° variation), and a near-linear geographic progression despite slight curvature. Although the intent suggests a gently curved route, the spatial scale of the segment (latitude ≈ 54.471 + 0.00016 × (longitude − 10.285)^2 over longitude [10.285, 10.300]) results in a maximum lateral deviation from linearity of only ~0.00012°, well within the acceptable error margin for linear approximation in maritime navigation contexts."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Route Adherence in Designated Shipping Lanes (applicable to cargo vessels navigating near Kanalfähre Breiholz and Lotsenstation Rüsterbergen)\nOperational Protocol Rationale: Cargo vessels operating under engine power in this region are expected to follow predefined curved routes that align with established maritime infrastructure, ensuring safe separation and predictable traffic flow. The observed stable speed, gradual and consistent course adjustment, and tight alignment between heading and direction of travel indicate controlled autopilot navigation along such a route. This behavior is characteristic of vessels transiting structured waterways where minor curvature is required to follow channel bends, as opposed to open-sea straight-line transit or maneuvering in congested ports. The slight change in course over time reflects a smooth turn consistent with these guided pathways, ruling out drifting, anchoring, or evasive maneuvers. Given the proximity to critical navigation points, maintaining a steady and predictable trajectory minimizes collision risk and supports efficient traffic management.\n'''",
