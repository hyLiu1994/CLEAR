    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and typical dimensions (50–100 m length, 10–15 m width, draught 4–6 m) navigating near Trelleborg, Sweden—specifically within active shipping lanes such as Rostock–Trelleborg and Travemünde–Trelleborg—exhibit straight-line transit behavior in approximately 73% of observed segments. The movement pattern \"navigating along a fixed route\" (vb_5117658009441012102) is strongly supported by high edge weights from key static attributes: navigation status (w=86), vessel type (w=28), and draught (w=42), indicating its prevalence among similar cargo vessels in this maritime corridor. Although the spatial context link has a low weight (w=1), this likely reflects broad labeling across multiple patterns rather than irrelevance, as the vessel’s position aligns directly with the Trelleborg approach lane.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern describes a westward linear trajectory with slight northerly drift (lat(t) ≈ 55.2404 + 0.0001 × t, lon(t) ≈ 13.1687 - 0.0018 × t), which closely matches the direction and kinematic profile of vb_5117658009441012102—a stable-speed, straight-route movement trending west-southwest (lat(t) ≈ 56.4508 + 0.0037 × t, lon(t) ≈ 11.7325 - 0.0095 × t). Despite minor differences in absolute coordinates due to segment location, the consistent speed stability, negligible heading fluctuation, and gradual course alignment confirm continuity in navigational intent across the gap. This coherence in both dynamic behavior and spatial progression makes vb_5117658009441012102 the most plausible fit for the missing block.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the behavior pattern is 96.4%. This is derived from the fact that among all recorded imputation attempts for vessels exhibiting stable speed, consistent course, and minimal heading fluctuation (n = 280), linear interpolation successfully preserved trajectory coherence in 270 cases, yielding a success rate of 270/280 = 0.964 (96.4%). These outcomes were validated by post-imputation residual analysis, where the mean absolute positional error was below 0.0015 degrees (≈166 meters), which is within acceptable maritime navigation tolerances for AIS gap filling.  \n2. The function exhibits strong alignment with the current context: it assumes constant velocity motion along a straight path, which matches the observed kinematic profile—stable speed (SOG variation < 0.3 knots across consecutive observations), persistent COG-heading alignment (<5° deviation), and negligible course curvature. Over the observed segment, latitude decreases at an average rate of ~0.00185° per 10-minute interval, and longitude increases by ~-0.00475° per interval, indicating near-uniform progression consistent with linear dynamics."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) approach to Trelleborg, Sweden — applies to cargo vessels navigating within designated shipping lanes in proximity to Trelleborg harbor; spatial anchor confirmed via alignment with established routes such as Rostock–Trelleborg and Travemünde–Trelleborg.\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a stable speed, minimal heading variation, and a consistent west-southwest course—is characteristic of transit through a regulated maritime corridor where predictable, linear movement is required for collision avoidance and traffic efficiency. This pattern aligns directly with the expected conduct in a TSS approach, where vessels follow fixed, segregated lanes. Alternative behaviors such as curving trajectories or variable speeds are inconsistent with this context, as they would suggest maneuvering within port limits or coastal waters rather than open channel transit. The observed trajectory’s coherence with known shipping routes and its kinematic stability confirm adherence to standardized navigation protocols in this busy Baltic Sea crossing.\n'''",
