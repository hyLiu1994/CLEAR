      "intent": "following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial: lat(t) ≈ 54.3391 - 0.0255 × t + 0.0008 × t², lon(t) ≈ 13.8324 - 0.0218 × t - 0.0003 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed moving segment)",
