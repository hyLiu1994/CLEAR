    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, passenger vessels 'under way using engine' with draughts in [4, 6) m and dimensions in the [150, 200) m length and [25, 30) m width range are strongly associated with curved route navigation patterns near structured maritime corridors. The induced subgraph shows that the pattern vb_82841811344196675 has high-weight connections from key static attributes: navigation_status (w=96), hazardous_cargo_no (w=96), vessel_type_Passenger (w=10), length (w=56), and width (w=30). When normalized across all outgoing edges from vessel attributes, this behavior pattern ranks among the most probable for passenger vessels in this operational state, particularly in contexts involving gradual course adjustments along defined waterways. While spatial context edges have low weight for this node, the dominant influence of propulsion status and vessel class supports its selection given the absence of anchoring or maneuvering behaviors.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern explicitly describes a \"following a curved maritime route\" with stable speed, gradual and consistent course change, and stable heading fluctuation—characteristics directly mirrored in vb_82841811344196675. Both the parametric trajectory model (lat(t) ≈ 56.150075 + 0.00085 × t + 0.000012 × t², lon(t) ≈ 7.621433 + 0.00035 × t + 0.000008 × t²) and the intent description align with the smooth curvature observed in the incomplete AIS samples, which show a continuous northeastward progression with increasing latitude and longitude at a non-linear rate. The duration range (200~250) matches typical segment lengths adjacent to the gap, and the stable dynamics are consistent with the vessel maintaining momentum along a predefined bend, likely within one of the nearby shipping lanes such as Rostock–Trelleborg or Travemünde–Trelleborg.\n'''"

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) applicability in the Baltic Sea near Rostock–Trelleborg and Travemünde–Trelleborg shipping lanes; applies to passenger vessels navigating within designated maritime corridors\nOperational Protocol Rationale: Passenger vessels operating under way with no hazardous cargo typically follow predefined curved routes in structured waterways to maintain safe separation from opposing traffic and avoid subsea infrastructure. The observed stable speed, consistent course adjustment, and minimal heading variation indicate the vessel is navigating a gentle arc along a defined channel—consistent with standard routing measures in busy Baltic Sea transit zones. This behavior rules out anchoring, random maneuvering, or abrupt course changes, which would disrupt traffic flow or indicate distress. Instead, the gradual northeastward turn aligns with expected navigation through coordinated shipping lanes, where autopilot-assisted path following ensures compliance with international collision regulations and regional traffic management.\n'''",
