  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (the persistent zero speed (SOG = 0.0) combined with small oscillations in latitude and longitude around 53.89395–53.8940 and 9.14475–9.14476, respectively, indicates the vessel is stationary within a very tight geographic box; this behavior is typical of a vessel at anchor or moored, where GPS noise or minor drift causes negligible position shifts without actual navigation; position bounds: latitude ∈ [53.89395, 53.8940], longitude ∈ [9.14475, 9.14477])",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains zero speed across multiple observations, indicating no movement)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (COG varies significantly between 138.4°, 318.4°, 48.0°, and other values despite no motion, suggesting invalid or erratic reporting when stationary)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains around 48–49° with minimal variation, even as COG changes, indicating the vessel is not maneuvering but sensors report inconsistent COG)",
