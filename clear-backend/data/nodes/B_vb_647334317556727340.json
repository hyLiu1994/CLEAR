  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 6.4 and 6.9 knots across the trajectory, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases from approximately 209° to 250° over the sequence, then stabilizes around 240°–250°, reflecting a smooth, continuous turn followed by straight-line travel)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading varies only slightly, within ±3° of COG, suggesting controlled, deliberate steering without oscillation)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
