  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving westward with a slight northerly drift, approximated by the parametric equations:",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 8.8 and 9.0 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 183.9° and 185.6°, showing a smooth progression without abrupt changes)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading oscillates only between 183.0° and 184.0°, indicating minor adjustments typical of autopilot steering)",
