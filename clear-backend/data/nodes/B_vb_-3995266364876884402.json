  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving west-northwest, approximated by the parametric equations: lat(t) ≈ 54.346238 + 0.00137 × t, lon(t) ≈ 9.912938 - 0.00339 × t, where t is a normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed, with SOG varying only slightly between 6.6 and 6.8 knots over multiple observations)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes very slightly around 299°, with minor fluctuations between 297.6° and 299.6°, indicating a smooth, controlled progression)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains consistently at 298°–299°, closely aligned with COG, suggesting no erratic yawing or instability)",
