  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving west-southwest, approximated by the parametric equations: lat(t) ≈ 55.0338 - 0.0061 × t, lon(t) ≈ 13.9258 - 0.0170 × t, where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 13.3 and 13.7 knots, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG remains stable at 247–248° across all observations, with only minor stepwise adjustments, indicating a smooth, intentional course)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading is consistently 249° throughout the trajectory, showing no oscillation or instability in vessel orientation)",
    "Behavior intent: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving west-southwest, approximated by the parametric equations: lat(t) ≈ 55.0338 - 0.0061 × t, lon(t) ≈ 13.9258 - 0.0170 × t, where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
