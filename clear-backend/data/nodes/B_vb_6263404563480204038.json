    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 13.0–13.1 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG remains tightly clustered around 104.8° with minor fluctuations, indicating a smooth, sustained directional movement)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading is consistently reported at 104.0°, showing minimal deviation from the intended direction)",
