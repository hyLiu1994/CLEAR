  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (the combination of zero speed, fixed heading, and repeated identical latitude/longitude coordinates indicates the vessel is stationary; minor positional variations (~±0.0001° in lat/lon, ~10-meter range) are likely due to GPS noise or buoyancy effects while moored, forming a tight cluster around 55.71136°N, 12.60230°E)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains zero or near-zero speed across consecutive observations, indicating no significant movement)",
    "Course change: stable (COG remains nearly constant despite lack of movement, suggesting the vessel is not altering its intended direction)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains fixed at 110.0° throughout the sequence, indicating no active turning or yawing)",
    "Behavior intent: anchored or moored in a confined area (the combination of zero speed, fixed heading, and repeated identical latitude/longitude coordinates indicates the vessel is stationary; minor positional variations (~±0.0001° in lat/lon, ~10-meter range) are likely due to GPS noise or buoyancy effects while moored, forming a tight cluster around 55.71136°N, 12.60230°E)",
