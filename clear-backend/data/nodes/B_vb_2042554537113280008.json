    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 10.1 and 11.5 knots with only minor fluctuations)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly and monotonically from ~311° to ~257° over time, indicating a smooth turning maneuver)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 293°–317°, with small adjustments aligned with COG trends)",
