  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (after initial movement with stable SOG and COG aligned with heading, the vessel comes to a complete stop (SOG = 0.0) while COG and heading diverge, followed by small oscillations in position—latitude varying within [56.158607, 56.158662], longitude within [14.816173, 14.816293]—indicating no active propulsion; this clustering of positions over time with zero speed and fluctuating heading reflects anchoring or mooring behavior in a tight geographic footprint, modeled as a stationary point with measurement noise or minor swinging due to wind/current)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 8.9 and 10.4 knots, with minor gradual decrease before stopping)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG remains nearly constant around 7.4°, indicating a steady direction with minimal deviation)",
    "Heading fluctuation: gradual and consistent (heading is stable at 9.0°–193.0°, but shows a distinct shift from ~9° to ~192°, indicating a significant turn after motion ceases)",
