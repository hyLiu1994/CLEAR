  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 6.5 and 7.1 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases slowly from 19.0° to 22.7° over time, indicating a smooth, continuous turn or alignment with a curved waterway)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains constant at 18–21°, suggesting autopilot or track-keeping system in use with small corrections)",
