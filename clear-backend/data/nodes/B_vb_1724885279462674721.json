    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed, with SOG varying only slightly between 12.0 and 13.4 knots across the segment)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG shows a slow, steady progression around 174°, with minor fluctuations between 173° and 176°, indicating a smooth directional trend)",
    "Heading fluctuation: gradual and consistent (heading remains fixed at 175.0° throughout the sequence, showing no abrupt changes or oscillations)",
