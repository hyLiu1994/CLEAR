    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and dimensions typical of medium-sized freighters (150–200 m length, 20–25 m width) navigating near major Baltic shipping lanes such as Aurora and HVDC NordBalt are observed to follow straight, fixed maritime routes in approximately 62% of cases when traversing open-sea segments. This pattern is most strongly associated with the vessel’s static attributes—particularly navigation status and vessel type—which link to this behavior with combined edge weights accounting for over 60% of the total support among all candidate patterns. The high edge weights from \"navigation_status: Under way using engine\" (w=102) and \"vessel_type: Cargo\" (w=73) indicate that this movement is highly representative of standard transit behavior for cargo ships in unrestricted waters along established traffic corridors.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable speed (~11.0–11.1 knots), consistent COG (237.0°–238.0°), fixed heading (234.0°), and intent to navigate a linear west-southwest trajectory. While the candidate movement vb_-4927443205807001530 describes a northeast-bound linear path, its core behavioral characteristics—stable speed, minimal heading fluctuation, gradual course consistency, and intent to follow a fixed route—are directly aligned with the boundary dynamics. The slight directional mismatch is outweighed by the strong kinematic coherence: both exhibit straight-line motion with engine-powered steady-state navigation. Given the absence of turning or maneuvering indicators in the boundary data, the most plausible continuation is a similarly stable, rectilinear movement, making vb_-4927443205807001530 the best match in terms of dynamic profile and navigational intent.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that function `vf_-7663396197665720575` can correctly impute missing values for the given behavior pattern is 98.04%, calculated as follows: Among the two candidate functions linked to the behavior pattern `vb_-4927443205807001530`, the edge weights are 100 and 2, respectively. The normalized weight (interpreted as frequency of successful association in historical performance) for `vf_-7663396197665720575` is computed as 100 / (100 + 2) = 0.9804, or 98.04%. This indicates a strong statistical preference based on prior execution reliability under identical kinematic conditions.  \n\n2. This function is specifically designed for linear interpolation using time-proportional scaling with `max(Time_interval)` as the normalizing factor, which matches the observed temporal structure in the vessel’s motion—stable speed, consistent COG, and minimal heading fluctuation. In contrast, `vf_5240413252068673064` uses `Time_interval[-1]` for normalization, which assumes the last timestamp is the maximum, potentially introducing error if the interval is not pre-sorted or normalized. Given that the behavior pattern explicitly models position progression via parametric linear equations over a normalized time index from 0 to 1, `vf_-7663396197665720575`'s use of `max(Time_interval)` aligns more precisely with this mathematical formulation."
