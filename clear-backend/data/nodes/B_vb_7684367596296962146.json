  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation: lat(t) ≈ 54.1495 + 0.0058 × t + 0.00012 × t², lon(t) ≈ 9.3634 + 0.0142 × t + 0.00028 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 6.5 and 6.8 knots over the majority of the trajectory, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases slowly and monotonically from 57.5° to 67.3°, reflecting a smooth, continuous turn to starboard)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 57.0° to 68.0°, closely aligned with COG, suggesting controlled steering without oscillation)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation: lat(t) ≈ 54.1495 + 0.0058 × t + 0.00012 × t², lon(t) ≈ 9.3634 + 0.0142 × t + 0.00028 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
