  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route forms a small elliptical pattern, approximated by a parametric equation of a circle with radius ~20 meters: lat(t) ≈ 55.711867 + 0.000017 × sin(2πt), lon(t) ≈ 10.970667 + 0.000017 × cos(2πt), where t ∈ [0,1] represents normalized time over the loop; this reflects the vessel turning in place or adjusting position within a confined harbor area, likely during docking preparation or anchoring",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of 0.1–0.2 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (the COG varies significantly, from 5° to 232°, indicating frequent and abrupt changes in direction)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (the heading remains within a narrow range of 272°–277°, showing minimal variation despite COG shifts)",
