    "Function description: This function performs linear interpolation between the known start and end positions to estimate missing latitude and longitude points along a vessel's trajectory. Given the observed pattern of stable speed, consistent course over ground (COG), and minimal heading fluctuations, it is reasonable to assume that the vessel maintained a near-constant direction and speed during the data gap. Therefore, a straight-line path proportional to time is an appropriate model. The function scales each position increment based on the relative time within the interval, producing a smooth sequence of intermediate coordinates that align with the vessel’s steady south-southwesterly motion. This approach ensures temporal consistency and reflects the vessel’s likely behavior under autopilot on a fixed maritime route.",
