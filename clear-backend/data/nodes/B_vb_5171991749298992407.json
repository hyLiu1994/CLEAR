    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 10.9–11.0 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases slowly and consistently from 80.0° to 82.0°, indicating a smooth, progressive turn to the right)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains fixed at 82.0°, showing no oscillation or abrupt changes)",
