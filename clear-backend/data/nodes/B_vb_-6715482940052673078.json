  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading oscillations, and slowly changing COG suggests navigation along a gently curving channel or coastal route; the position progression follows an approximate arc defined by Δlat ≈ k·Δlong with local curvature, modeled as a circular segment: (lat - lat₀)² + (long - long₀)² ≈ R² where R ~ 25–30 km based on turning rate and SOG)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 9.8–9.9 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (the COG varies slowly between 47.6° and 50.3°, indicating a smooth, continuous turn or alignment with a curved route)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (the heading remains close to 56°, with only minor variations of ±1°, suggesting steady rudder control)",
