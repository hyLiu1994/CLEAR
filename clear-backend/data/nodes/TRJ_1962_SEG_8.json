    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with a draught between 8–10 m navigating near major Baltic shipping lanes (including Klaipėda–Kiel and Travemünde–Helsinki) exhibit curved route-following behavior in approximately 78% of observed segments when aligned with vessel dimensions of 100–150 m length and 20–25 m beam. The pattern vb_3081913737957353482 is strongly supported by co-occurring static attributes: navigation status (combined edge weight = 178), vessel type (w=126), and spatial context (w=3), indicating frequent use in structured maritime corridors requiring gentle course adjustments. Among all candidate patterns, this movement ranks highest in cumulative attribute alignment for vessels operating in high-traffic Baltic routes.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement patterns both describe stable-speed navigation along gently curving paths with gradual and consistent course changes, radius ~2.5 km circular arc trajectories, and durations of 250–300 seconds—precisely matching the intent and kinematic profile of vb_3081913737957353482. The parametric equations from the left and right boundary segments show latitudinal and longitudinal progression consistent with the curvature modeled in vb_3081913737957353482 (lat(t) ≈ 54.949173 + 0.0006×t + 0.00005×t², lon(t) ≈ 13.67999 + 0.0028×t + 0.00012×t²), which bridges the geographic gap between the last known position at (54.94156, 13.749937) and the resuming track near (54.956447, 13.826983). This movement maintains stable speed, heading, and COG evolution, ensuring continuity in both dynamic behavior and spatial trajectory across the missing block.\n'''"

These patterns are commonly observed near major Baltic shipping lanes, where vessels must follow gently curving channels to align with traffic separation schemes and coastal navigation constraints. The observed trajectory curvature aligns with known routing measures in this region, distinguishing it from straight-line open-sea transit or maneuvering in congested port areas. This behavior ensures safe passage through high-traffic zones while maintaining predictable motion for surrounding traffic.\n'''",
