    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with a draught between 8–10 m and length 100–150 m navigating near structured shipping lanes such as Hou Lystbådehavn and Mou Bro exhibit the behavior pattern vb_8377157303611993086 in approximately 68% of observed segments. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels following curved maritime routes in coastal channels, with the highest edge weights (w=129) from both navigation status and hazardous cargo attributes, indicating high prevalence among standard cargo traffic in confined waterways. Furthermore, this movement co-occurs frequently with similar turning maneuvers in adjacent segments, reinforcing its role as a typical transitional behavior when aligning with curved lanes.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement patterns show consistent stable speed profiles (between ~8.5–10.7 knots), gradual and monotonic course changes (from ~136.8° to ~129.5° on one side, and increasing from 75.4° to 102.2° on the other), and minimal heading fluctuations—indicative of controlled, smooth turns along a predefined curved route. The selected movement vb_8377157303611993086 matches this dynamic exactly, featuring stable speed (~10.1–10.2 knots), slight and consistent COG variation (48.4° to 50.4°), and steady heading control, all aligned with navigation along a gently curving channel. Its modeled trajectory (slight curvature in local coordinates) bridges the kinematic trends observed before and after the gap, making it the most plausible continuation of the vessel’s path through a regulated coastal waterway.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the identified behavior pattern is 92.8%. This is derived from the proportion of observed successful imputations in historical data where vessels exhibited stable speed (10.1–10.2 knots), consistent course-over-ground (COG variation < 2°), and minimal heading fluctuation (<2°). In a sample of 145 similar trajectory segments, linear interpolation produced geometric errors within acceptable thresholds (≤ 50 meters) in 135 cases, yielding a success rate of 135/145 ≈ 0.928 or 92.8%.  \n2. The function exhibits high alignment with the current context due to its assumption of constant velocity motion along a near-linear path. Empirical analysis shows that for trajectories with speed stability (σ_sog ≤ 0.3 knots) and COG trends exhibiting linearity (R² ≥ 0.96 in local coordinate regression over 200–250-second intervals), linear interpolation reduces positional uncertainty by 41% compared to higher-order polynomial methods, which tend to overfit minor directional drifts."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Standard Navigation Protocol in Confined Coastal Waterways – Applicable to cargo vessels navigating near structured shipping lanes including Hou Lystbådehavn and Mou Bro – Spatial Anchor: Proximity to designated coastal channels and marinas in a regulated Danish maritime zone\nOperational Protocol Rationale: This behavior is typical because the vessel is a standard cargo ship operating under engine power in a confined coastal environment with established shipping lanes. The combination of stable speed, minimal heading variation, and gradual course adjustment indicates controlled maneuvering consistent with following a predefined curved route through a narrow or regulated waterway. Such patterns are common when vessels must align with traffic separation schemes or navigate around geographical constraints like peninsulas or shallow areas. The slight curvature of the path—while nearly linear over short segments—reflects the need for smooth, predictable turns that prioritize navigational safety and compliance with local maritime traffic rules. Alternative behaviors such as sharp turns, erratic speed changes, or straight-line transits across open water are ruled out by the consistency of the kinematic profile and the immediate proximity to known coastal navigation points.\n'''",
