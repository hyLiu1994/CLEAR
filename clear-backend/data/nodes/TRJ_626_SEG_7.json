    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' navigating in Danish waters—particularly near critical shipping lanes such as Storebælt, Samsø Bælt, and unnamed coastal routes—frequently exhibit behavior patterns consistent with gently curving trajectory navigation. This specific pattern (vb_82841811344196675) is strongly associated with vessels of similar dimensions (100–150 m length, 20–25 m width) and draught (8–10 m), operating under standard open-water conditions without hazardous cargo. The graph edge weights indicate that this behavior co-occurs with the vessel’s static attributes in 96 out of 129 instances for navigation status, 83 out of 118 for vessel type, and 54 out of 65 for width, translating to a high conditional prevalence (~74%–84%) across key attributes. Among all candidate patterns, it ranks second in cumulative support from core vessel characteristics, reflecting its typicality for mid-sized cargo vessels maneuvering along curved maritime corridors in this region.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable speed around 16.3–16.6 knots, a gradual course change from 352.3° to 9.5°, and eventual stabilization near 9.0°–9.5°, indicating a smooth transition along a curved route. While the gap's immediate samples show continued northeasterly progression, vb_82841811344196675 aligns best with this behavioral trend—featuring stable speed, gradual and consistent course evolution, and intent to follow a curved maritime route modeled as a circular arc (~2.5 km radius)—despite a slightly lower speed differential. Its parametric trajectory model (lat/lon quadratic in time) matches the spatial curvature implied by the boundary segments, and its duration range (200–250) fits plausibly within the observed gap span. Unlike straight-route patterns (e.g., vb_-4927443205807001530), it accounts for the ongoing course adjustment, making it the most kinematically and contextually consistent choice.\n'''"

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) in Danish Waters – Applicable in proximity to major shipping lanes including Storebælt and Samsø Bælt\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The selected behavior reflects a typical navigation pattern for mid-sized cargo vessels transiting through Denmark’s complex coastal waterways, where curved routing is required to safely align with established traffic lanes. The vessel's consistent speed, minimal heading variation, and gradual course adjustment indicate controlled maneuvering along a predefined curved path—characteristic of TSS entry or lane-following procedures in confined maritime zones. This pattern aligns with standard operating procedures for non-hazardous cargo vessels navigating between key Danish straits, ensuring separation from opposing traffic and adherence to charted routes. Unlike straight-path behaviors, which assume unobstructed transit, this choice accounts for the observed turning motion and spatial curvature, making it more representative of actual seafaring practice in this regulated environment.\n'''",
