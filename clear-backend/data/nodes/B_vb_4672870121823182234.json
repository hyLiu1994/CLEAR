    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 12.5 and 12.8 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly from 223.4° to 197.6° over time, indicating a smooth, continuous turn rather than abrupt maneuvers)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading varies only slightly, decreasing gradually from 223.0° to 193.0°, with small stepwise adjustments)",
