  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route forms a small elliptical pattern, approximated by a parametric equation of a circle with radius ~20 meters: (lat(t), lon(t)) ≈ (56.4159 + 0.0001 × cos(2πt), 10.92815 + 0.00015 × sin(2πt)), where t ∈ [0,1] represents normalized time over the loop; this reflects the vessel turning in place or adjusting position within a confined harbor area, likely during docking preparation or anchoring",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a low and consistent speed, mostly between 0.0 and 0.4 knots, indicating minimal propulsion or drifting)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes smoothly from ~314° to ~360°/0°, then fluctuates around 0°–35° and later jumps to 198.9° and 320.5°, suggesting rotational maneuvering near a fixed point)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains nearly constant at 22°–24° despite COG variations, indicating rudder adjustments while main orientation stays fixed)",
