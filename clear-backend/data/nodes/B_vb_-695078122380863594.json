    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 10.3 and 10.7 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 189.4° and 192.2°, indicating a smooth, sustained turn or alignment with a curved route)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 193° to 195°, showing minimal oscillation around a mean direction)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, consistent heading, and slowly varying COG suggests navigation along a predefined curved channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a great-circle arc or rhumb line with gentle curvature over time)",
