    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 10.4 and 11.5 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly from ~255° to ~271°, then decreases slightly to ~268°, indicating a smooth, progressive turn over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading varies only between 255° and 277°, remaining closely aligned with COG, suggesting controlled steering without erratic behavior)",
