  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial: longitude ≈ a·(latitude)² + b·latitude + c, where coefficients are fitted to observed lat-lon pairs)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 6.7 and 6.8 knots, indicating steady propulsion without acceleration or deceleration)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG shifts slightly from 69.8° to 70.8°, then back to 69.8°, showing a smooth evolution over time, typical of following a predefined curved route)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains consistently at 69.0° or 70.0°, with minimal variation, suggesting precise rudder control and no erratic yawing)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial: longitude ≈ a·(latitude)² + b·latitude + c, where coefficients are fitted to observed lat-lon pairs)",
