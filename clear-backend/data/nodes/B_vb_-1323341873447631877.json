  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 6.2 and 7.0 knots across multiple observations, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly and monotonically over time, e.g., from 7.8° to 49.0° then to 118.9°, reflecting a smooth turn rather than abrupt maneuvers)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading values remain closely aligned with COG, with small deviations under 3°, suggesting no erratic rudder movements)",
