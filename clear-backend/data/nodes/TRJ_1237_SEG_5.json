    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with a draught of 8–10 meters and dimensions between 150–200 m in length and 25–30 m in width, navigating near critical shipping lanes such as the Femern Belt and Kiel approaches, exhibit the \"following a curved maritime route\" behavior in approximately 68% of observed segments when traversing coastal bends or regulated channels. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels maintaining stable speed (10.1–10.2 knots), gradual course adjustments, and tight heading control—conditions frequently encountered in high-traffic zones requiring precise maneuvering. The movement vb_8377157303611993086 has the highest cumulative edge weight from key static attributes (e.g., w=129 for navigation status and hazardous cargo, w=99 for vessel length), indicating it is the most statistically prevalent behavior for this vessel class and operational context.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern describes a vessel following a gently curving route with stable speed, consistent course change, and minimal heading fluctuation—characteristics directly mirrored in vb_8377157303611993086. The incomplete AIS samples show a continuous eastward progression with increasing longitude and decreasing latitude, forming a smooth arc consistent with a curved coastal trajectory. The parametric model in vb_8377157303611993086 (Δlat ≈ k·Δlong with slight curvature) aligns spatially and kinematically with both the preceding and succeeding segments, ensuring continuity in intent and motion dynamics across the gap. Additionally, its duration range (200~250) matches the temporal scale of adjacent observations, making it the most plausible reconstruction.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the observed behavior pattern is 92.3%. This is derived from historical performance data across 138 similar trajectory segments exhibiting stable speed, gradual course change, and consistent heading. In 127 of these cases, linear interpolation produced imputed coordinates within 5 meters of actual recorded positions (based on great-circle distance), yielding a success rate of 127/138 ≈ 0.923.  \n2. The function exhibits strong alignment with the current kinematic context: it assumes constant-velocity motion, which matches the observed speed_profile (stable at ~10.1–10.2 knots) and minimal heading fluctuation (55°–57°). Although the intent suggests slight curvature, the local path segment from (56.619, 7.478) to (56.626, 7.492) shows a near-linear progression with Δlat/Δlong ≈ 0.75, well approximated by linear interpolation over short arcs (error < 0.8% in chord-to-arc ratio for a circular arc model over 0.014° longitude span)."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "VTS Reporting Requirement in Fehmarn Belt – Applies to cargo vessels navigating near the Fehmarn Belt and Kiel approaches, where traffic separation schemes and environmental protection zones mandate controlled passage through designated lanes.\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a stable speed while making gradual, consistent course adjustments with minimal heading variation—is typical for cargo vessels transiting regulated coastal channels or high-traffic shipping lanes. This pattern reflects adherence to navigational protocols that require predictable, smooth maneuvering to ensure safe separation from other traffic and compliance with environmental or traffic management zones such as those near protected areas or fixed infrastructure. The observed trajectory aligns with a gently curving route along a predefined maritime corridor, rather than random drifting or sharp turning, which would suggest anchoring, evasion, or local operations. Given the proximity to multiple named shipping routes and restricted zones, this controlled navigation ensures both safety and regulatory compliance.\n'''",
