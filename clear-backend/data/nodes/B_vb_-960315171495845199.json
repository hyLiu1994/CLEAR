    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 16.2 and 16.7 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG shifts from ~115° to ~90°, then stabilizes around 88°–91°, indicating a smooth, continuous turn followed by straight-line travel)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains tightly constrained between 89° and 91° after initial phase, with only minor variations during course adjustment)",
