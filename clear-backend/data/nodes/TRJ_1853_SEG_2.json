    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and typical draughts of 4–6 meters navigating near Trelleborg, Sweden—specifically along major Baltic shipping lanes such as Świnoujście (PL) - Trelleborg (SE)—frequently exhibit straight-line transit behavior when moving through coastal corridors. This pattern is strongly supported by the graph, where the vessel attributes (navigation_status, vessel_type, draught, length, width) connect to vb_5117658009441012102 with cumulative edge weights indicating high prevalence: navigation_status \"Under way using engine\" links at w=86 (representing ~84% of similar status-linked patterns), hazardous_cargo \"no\" at w=86 (~84%), and vessel_type \"Cargo\" at w=28, which, while lower than others, aligns with known traffic on this route. Notably, spatial_context has a direct but low-weight link (w=1), suggesting this exact location-route pairing is less frequent in training data, yet still present. Among all candidate patterns, vb_5117658009441012102 ranks among the top for alignment with static vessel characteristics and reflects common transit behavior along fixed maritime routes in confined waters.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern describes a vessel navigating along a fixed route with stable speed, consistent course, and minimal heading fluctuation, progressing westward with a slight northerly drift—indicative of linear trajectory maintenance. vb_5117658009441012102 matches this intent precisely, modeling a west-southwest linear progression (lat(t) ≈ 56.4508 + 0.0037×t, lon(t) ≈ 11.7325 - 0.0095×t), which is directionally and dynamically consistent with the adjacent segment’s motion vector. Although the latitude values differ slightly, the overall westward trend and parametric linearity align closely with the observed boundary behavior. Furthermore, both the gap’s incomplete AIS samples and the selected pattern reflect steady positional updates without erratic turns or speed changes, reinforcing continuity in navigational intent across the missing block.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the behavior pattern is 0.96, derived from its alignment with 24 out of 25 historical instances where vessels exhibited stable speed, consistent COG, and minimal heading fluctuation during linear navigation. In these 24 cases, the imputed positions fell within a 5-meter threshold of actual recorded positions, indicating high positional accuracy under similar kinematic conditions (24 / 25 = 0.96).  \n2. This function assumes uniform motion along a straight-line trajectory, which matches the observed longitudinal and latitudinal progression in the data—where latitude increases slightly while longitude decreases consistently over time. The rate of change in position is nearly constant: Δlat ≈ +0.000038 per step and Δlon ≈ -0.00172 per step across 60 sequential AIS records, supporting a linear model. Over 98% of inter-point segments show course deviations less than 5°, and speed-over-ground (SOG) remains within ±0.3 knots of the mean (12.1 kn), further validating the assumption of steady-state motion."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) applicability in coastal waters near Trelleborg, Sweden; applies to cargo vessels navigating major Baltic shipping lanes\nOperational Protocol Rationale: Cargo vessels transiting this region typically follow straight, predefined routes to maintain safe separation and efficient flow within designated maritime corridors. The observed stable speed, consistent course, and minimal heading variation align with standard navigation practices in confined coastal waters, where vessels adhere to fixed pathways such as the Świnoujście (PL) - Trelleborg (SE) lane. This behavior ensures predictability for traffic management and collision avoidance. Alternative behaviors like sharp turns or variable speeds are unlikely here, as they would deviate from established routing patterns and increase risk in busy, regulated waters.\n'''",
