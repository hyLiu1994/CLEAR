    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 8.9 and 9.1 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 183.9° and 185.4°, showing a slow, steady evolution over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading oscillates narrowly around 183–184°, indicating minimal rudder activity and controlled steering)",
