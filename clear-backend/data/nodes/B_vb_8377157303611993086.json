  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small and consistent COG changes, and steady heading suggests the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal route; the position progression follows an approximately linear-to-slightly-curvilinear path from (56.619, 7.478) to (56.626, 7.492), which can be modeled as a segment of a circular arc or polynomial curve: Δlat ≈ k·Δlong with slight curvature, where k ≈ 0.7–0.8 in local coordinates)",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 10.1–10.2 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 48.4° and 50.4°, showing a slow, smooth adjustment in direction over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains consistently around 55°–57°, with minimal variation, indicating steady helm control)",
