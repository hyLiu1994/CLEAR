    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' navigating in confined waters near port areas such as Aalborg—where multiple named shipping lanes and harbor infrastructure are present—frequently exhibit straight-line transit behavior when moving through regulated channels. This pattern is strongly supported by the graph, where the vessel’s static attributes (Cargo type, [100, 150) m length, [8, 10) m draught, no hazardous cargo) link to vb_-4927443205807001530 with high cumulative edge weights. Specifically, navigation_status \"Under way using engine\" connects to this behavior with a weight of 102, representing 62.6% of the maximum possible weight among competing patterns, while vessel_type_Cargo contributes 73 (57.5% of max), and spatial_context reflects proximity to structured maritime infrastructure, reinforcing adherence to fixed routes. The combined evidence suggests that under these operational and spatial conditions, maintaining a fixed route with stable speed and minimal course deviation is the most statistically prevalent behavior.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a vessel with stable speed near zero, constant COG at 111.6°, and fixed heading at 60.0°, indicating it is effectively stationary but aligned with a predefined navigational direction—likely moored or drifting slightly within a channel. The selected movement vb_-4927443205807001530 describes a “navigating along a fixed route” intent with stable speed, gradual course consistency, and linear northeastward progression, which aligns directly with the orientation and behavioral continuity implied by the boundary state. Given that the vessel is positioned in a dense network of named shipping lanes near Aalborg Harbor and was previously aligned with a fixed trajectory, resuming a straight, predefined route after a data gap is the most plausible restoration, ensuring spatiotemporal and navigational coherence across the segment boundaries.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that vf_-7663396197665720575 is the correct choice for imputing missing latitude and longitude under the given behavior pattern is approximately 98.04%. This is derived from the relative weight distribution in the association graph, where the total weight from the behavior pattern vb_-4927443205807001530 to all candidate functions is 100 + 2 = 102. The weight assigned to vf_-7663396197665720575 is 100. Therefore, the selection probability is calculated as 100 / 102 ≈ 0.9804 or 98.04%. This high proportion indicates strong empirical alignment between this function and the observed kinematic behavior.  \n2. The function vf_-7663396197665720575 has been consistently associated with trajectories exhibiting stable speed, consistent course over ground (COG), and minimal heading fluctuations—exactly matching the characteristics of the current vessel segment. Its model assumes linear motion proportional to time, which aligns with the parametric trajectory approximation provided in the intent (lat(t) ≈ 56.114153 + 0.00087 × t, lon(t) ≈ 7.607993 + 0.00034 × t). In contrast, vf_5240413252068673064, while also linear, shows weaker statistical linkage (weight = 2), suggesting less proven reliability for this specific motion regime."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Mandatory Route Adherence — Applicable in Confined Waters Near Port Areas; spatial anchor: Aalborg Harbor and Adjacent Shipping Lanes\nOperational Protocol Rationale: In the dense network of named shipping lanes near Aalborg Harbor, vessels—particularly cargo ships of moderate size (100–150 m length, 8–10 m draught)—typically follow strictly defined, linear routes to ensure safe passage through confined and potentially congested waters. The observed stable speed, consistent course over ground, and minimal heading variation indicate the vessel is operating under autopilot along a regulated channel, where deviations are minimized for navigational safety. This behavior aligns with standard port approach procedures, which prioritize predictable, straight-line motion to reduce collision risk. Alternative behaviors involving turns or variable speed are less likely here due to the proximity to harbor infrastructure and the presence of multiple fixed maritime pathways, which constrain maneuvering options.\n'''",
