    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 15.2–15.3 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes very slightly, ranging from 274.1° to 274.8°, indicating a smooth, almost straight westward movement with minimal directional adjustment)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains fixed at 273.0° across all observations, showing precise rudder control and no oscillatory behavior)",

    "Duration: 200~250"
