    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 15.4–15.5 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 272.7° and 273.4°, showing a smooth, persistent westward progression with a minor northerly curvature)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains fixed at 272.0°, indicating minimal yaw and controlled steering)",
