    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' navigating in open waters near major shipping lanes such as Pangea North UK/Denmark exhibit straight-route behavior patterns like this in approximately 62% of comparable movement gaps. The vessel’s static attributes—particularly its type (Cargo), navigation status, and dimensions—show strongest association with this pattern, as evidenced by cumulative edge weights (w=102 for navigation status, w=102 for no hazardous cargo, w=73 for vessel type), which represent the highest combined support among all candidates for a fixed-route intent. Additionally, this pattern frequently co-occurs with vessels of similar draught and size operating in well-defined maritime corridors, reinforcing its plausibility in structured traffic environments.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a vessel maintaining stable speed (15.4–16.1 knots), consistent heading (358.0°), and a nearly constant COG (353.9°–355.5°), indicating uninterrupted progression along a linear west-northwest trajectory. This aligns closely with the intent of vb_-4927443205807001530—navigating along a fixed route—characterized by stable speed, minimal course deviation, and a linear northeast-bound parametric trajectory. Although the direction differs, the kinematic consistency (stable speed, aligned COG and heading, no fluctuations) and the structural similarity in intent (following a predefined straight path) make it the most plausible continuation given the gap's boundary conditions and the vessel’s persistent alignment with established routing.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the behavior pattern is 98.04%. This is derived from the proportional weight distribution in the relationship between the behavior pattern and candidate functions. The total weight sum from the behavior pattern to all functions is 100 + 2 = 102. The weight assigned to vf_-7663396197665720575 is 100, leading to a success likelihood of (100 / 102) ≈ 0.9804 or 98.04%. This high proportion indicates strong empirical alignment between this function and the observed kinematic pattern.\n\n2. This function exhibits characteristics of time-proportional linear interpolation with explicit scaling relative to the maximum time interval, ensuring temporal consistency across imputed points. It matches the current context precisely—where the vessel demonstrates stable speed, consistent COG, and negligible heading fluctuation—by modeling motion as uniform and directional. Its formulation assumes constant velocity along a straight path, which aligns with the parametric trajectory model (lat(t), lon(t)) provided in the intent description. In contrast, the alternative function uses Time_interval[-1] for normalization—an equivalent computation but with less explicit clarity in temporal scaling—yet both are mathematically similar. However, the primary function's design has been historically associated with higher accuracy in AIS imputation tasks involving fixed-route navigation, as evidenced by its dominant weighting in successful prior applications."
