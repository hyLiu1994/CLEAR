    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 10.9–11.0 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 214.6° and 217.2°, showing a slow, smooth evolution over time, indicating a continuous turn or curved path)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 210.0° to 214.0°, with minimal short-term variation, suggesting controlled steering)",
    "Behavior intent: 'following a curved maritime route'",
