    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and dimensions in the [100, 150) m length and [20, 25) m width range are strongly associated with straight-route navigation patterns near structured maritime corridors. This specific behavior pattern (vb_-4927443205807001530) is highly prevalent among such vessels, supported by strong edge weights from key static attributes: navigation_status (w=102), vessel_type (w=73), and hazardous_cargo (w=102), which collectively indicate a statistically dominant behavioral pathway. When normalized across all outgoing edges from these attributes, this pattern accounts for approximately 62% of observed movements in similar navigational contexts, significantly higher than alternatives. Additionally, the absence of spatial context edges to high-traffic zones or port bends further supports that the vessel is on a consistent open-water route rather than maneuvering near terminals.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable, linear south-southeast trajectory with constant speed (~10.5 knots), minimal course deviation (COG: 191.6°–193.1°), and fixed heading (189.0°), indicating uninterrupted transit along a predefined route. Among the candidate movements, vb_-4927443205807001530 most closely matches this intent—navigating along a fixed straight route—with its own description of a linear northeast-bound trajectory under stable speed and aligned COG-heading dynamics. While the absolute direction differs, the underlying behavior—sustained directional control, steady speed, and negligible fluctuations—is structurally consistent with the continuity required across the gap. Other candidates involve curved routing with evolving COG trends, which would introduce detectable turning behavior inconsistent with the observed pre- and post-gap stability.\n'''"

The observed stable speed, minimal course deviation, and tight alignment between heading and direction of travel indicate the vessel is on autopilot following a predefined route. This behavior is consistent with transiting structured maritime zones near offshore installations, where predictable motion ensures collision avoidance and operational safety. Curved trajectory patterns were ruled out due to their association with maneuvering near bends or ports—conditions not supported by the vessel’s steady-state dynamics or its location relative to fixed infrastructure.\n'''",
