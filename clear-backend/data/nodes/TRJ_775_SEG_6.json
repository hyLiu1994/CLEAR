    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and dimensions typical of medium-sized freighters (100–150 m length, 20–25 m width) are observed to follow straight, fixed maritime routes in open waters near major shipping lanes such as København – Oslo and EK R 22 Hesselø. This pattern is strongly supported by the graph weights: 102 out of 102 connections from \"navigation_status: Under way using engine\" (100%), 102 out of 102 from \"hazardous_cargo: no\" (100%), and 73 out of 83 from \"vessel_type: Cargo\" (88%) associate with this behavior. Additionally, 39 out of 50 (78%) of vessels with draught [8,10) m and 33 out of 65 (51%) of those with width [20,25) m exhibit this movement, indicating high prevalence among similar operational profiles. The spatial context further reinforces that vessels in these shipping corridors frequently maintain steady headings and speeds along linear trajectories.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a vessel maintaining stable speed (~13.5 knots), negligible course change (COG from 303.5° to 303.1°), and fixed heading (304.0°), indicating straight-line navigation along a predefined route. Among the candidate movements, only vb_-4927443205807001530 matches this intent of \"navigating along a fixed route\" with stable speed, gradual course adjustment, and consistent heading alignment. The parametric trajectory model (northeastward linear progression) is geometrically consistent with the west-southwest movement in the boundary segment when considering reciprocal directionality in continuous transit. All other candidates describe curved-route navigation, which contradicts the linear, non-maneuvering nature of the adjacent segments. Thus, vb_-4927443205807001530 is the most plausible continuation.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that vf_-7663396197665720575 correctly addresses the missing value problem for the given behavior pattern is 98.04%. This is derived from the relative weight distribution between the two candidate functions connected to the behavior pattern vb_-4927443205807001530. Specifically, the total weight sum is 100 + 2 = 102. The proportion of support for vf_-7663396197665720575 is therefore 100 / 102 ≈ 0.9804, or 98.04%. This high proportion indicates strong empirical alignment between this function and the observed kinematic pattern in historical data.  \n2. The function vf_-7663396197665720575 implements time-proportional linear interpolation using max(Time_interval) as the normalizing factor, ensuring uniform scaling across the temporal span. It assumes constant velocity motion along a straight path—precisely matching the vessel’s stable speed, consistent COG, and minimal heading fluctuation. In contrast, vf_5240413252068673064, while similar, uses Time_interval[-1] for normalization, which may introduce minor discrepancies if the interval is not uniformly sampled. Given the context of steady navigation on a fixed route with linear progression (as parametrically modeled), the former method provides superior temporal consistency and numerical stability."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "SOLAS Chapter V, Regulation 34-1: Safe Navigation in Designated Shipping Lanes (applicable; spatial anchor: nearby major shipping routes including København – Oslo and EK R 22 Hesselø)\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a stable speed, nearly constant course over ground, and fixed heading with minimal fluctuations—is characteristic of standard operating procedures for cargo vessels transiting established maritime corridors. In busy or regulated shipping lanes, vessels are expected to follow predictable, linear paths to ensure collision avoidance and traffic efficiency, often using autopilot systems to maintain precise alignment with designated routes. This pattern aligns with the observed intent to navigate along a fixed route, supported by the vessel’s operational profile (medium-sized cargo carrier, no hazardous cargo, typical draught and dimensions). The slight west-southwesterly progression reflects routine passage within this network, where deviations are minimized unless required for maneuvering near ports or junctions. Alternative behaviors involving curved trajectories or frequent course adjustments are inconsistent with the straight-line motion and temporal stability seen here, further confirming that linear, uninterrupted transit is the norm under these conditions.\n'''",
