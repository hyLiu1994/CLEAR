  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation: lat(t) ≈ 54.0053 + 0.0027 × t + 0.0001 × t², lon(t) ≈ 9.2944 + 0.0007 × t + 0.00003 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 5.6 and 6.6 knots, with minor fluctuations typical of steady-state navigation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slowly from ~8.1° to ~10.4° over the sequence, indicating a smooth, progressive turn rather than abrupt changes)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains consistently around 10°–11°, with only minor variations of ±0.5°, suggesting controlled directional stability)",
