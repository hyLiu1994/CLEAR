    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed of approximately 15.2–15.3 knots across all observations)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 196.3° and 197.7°, showing a smooth, nearly constant course with minimal deviation)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains tightly clustered around 196°–197°, with only minor fluctuations of ±0.5°, indicating precise directional control)",
