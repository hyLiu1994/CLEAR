    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a constant speed of 0.0 knots across all observations, indicating no movement)",
    "Course change: stable (the COG remains fixed at 111.6° throughout the sequence, showing no change in intended direction)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (the heading is consistently reported as 60.0°, with no variation, suggesting the vessel is not maneuvering)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",
