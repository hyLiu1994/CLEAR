    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 15.9 and 16.1 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 216.1° and 216.9°, showing a smooth, sustained direction with minimal deviation)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains fixed at 216.0° across all observations, indicating no yawing or steering adjustments)",
