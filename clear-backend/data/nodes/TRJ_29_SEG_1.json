      "intent": "following a curved maritime route (the vessel progresses northeastward in a smooth arc, as indicated by the coordinated increase in both latitude and longitude paired with gradual COG changes; this is typical of vessels navigating along predefined curved shipping lanes or rounding a coastal feature)",
