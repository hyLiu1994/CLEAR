  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (the persistent zero speed (SOG = 0.0) combined with repeated identical latitude and longitude coordinates indicates the vessel is not moving; small variations in COG are artifacts of being stationary, likely due to tidal sway or sensor drift; the position is effectively fixed at latitude ≈56.151457°, longitude ≈10.236055°, consistent with anchoring or mooring in a harbor or port area)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains zero speed across all observations, indicating no movement)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (COG varies between approximately 168° and 182° despite no movement, suggesting sensor noise or minor swinging while stationary)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (the heading remains constant at 41.0°, indicating the vessel’s bow is fixed in orientation despite COG fluctuations)",
    "Behavior intent: anchored or moored in a confined area (the persistent zero speed (SOG = 0.0) combined with repeated identical latitude and longitude coordinates indicates the vessel is not moving; small variations in COG are artifacts of being stationary, likely due to tidal sway or sensor drift; the position is effectively fixed at latitude ≈56.151457°, longitude ≈10.236055°, consistent with anchoring or mooring in a harbor or port area)",
