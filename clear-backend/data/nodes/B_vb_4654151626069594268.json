    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 15.7 and 16.2 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 214.6° and 216.3°, showing a smooth progression without abrupt changes)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains consistently around 215°, with only minor fluctuations of ±1°)",
