    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and typical dimensions (100–150 m length, 20–25 m width, draught 6–8 m) navigating in open coastal waters near Sweden most frequently exhibit straight-line transit behavior, as evidenced by the strong edge weights from static attributes to this pattern. Specifically, the vessel’s navigation status and cargo type are linked to vb_-4927443205807001530 with a combined weight of 204 (navigation_status and hazardous_cargo each w=102), representing approximately 68% of the total weighted support for this node—indicating high prevalence among similar vessels maintaining steady course and speed on predefined routes. This pattern is more strongly supported than curved-route alternatives, which show lower cumulative attribute alignment.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern shows a stable trajectory with consistent speed (~19.2–19.3 knots), minimal course deviation (COG 320.4°–320.9°), fixed heading (323.0°), and linear west-southwest progression—indicative of uninterrupted transit along a fixed maritime route. The candidate movement vb_-4927443205807001530 matches this intent precisely, describing \"navigating along a fixed route\" with stable speed, aligned COG and heading, and a linear parametric model. While its direction (northeast) differs, the kinematic stability and behavioral intent—maintaining a constant path without maneuvering—are fully consistent with the continuity required across the gap. The other candidates describe curved routing with gradual turns, which would contradict the observed straight-line motion before and after the gap.\n'''"

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Undetermined\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel is a cargo ship operating under way with no hazardous cargo, in coastal waters near Sweden. It maintains a stable speed and a nearly constant course, with minimal variation between its direction of travel (COG) and heading—indicating it is following a straight, predefined maritime route without maneuvering. This behavior is typical for vessels transiting open coastal areas where traffic separation schemes or established shipping lanes encourage uninterrupted, linear movement to ensure navigational safety and efficiency. The observed kinematic stability—steady speed, fixed heading, and negligible course deviation—strongly supports continuous straight-line motion rather than a curved path, which would involve gradual turns inconsistent with the data. Alternative behaviors involving curved routing are less likely, as they imply intentional course adjustments not supported by the vessel’s consistent alignment and lack of yawing.\n'''",
