    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 10.2 and 10.5 knots across the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slowly between 353° and 360°, indicating a smooth, continuous adjustment in direction over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within 0–3°, showing minimal deviation from the intended orientation)",
