    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 9.8 and 10.4 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slowly between 354.3° and 359.1°, indicating a smooth, continuous adjustment in direction over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains nearly constant at 2.0°–4.0°, suggesting precise rudder control and no abrupt turns)",
