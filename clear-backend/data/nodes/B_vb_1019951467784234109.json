  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (the vessel shows zero or near-zero speed while COG fluctuates due to environmental forces like wind or current acting on a stationary vessel; the position oscillates slightly around latitude ~54.3662, longitude ~10.1420, forming a tight cluster with a diameter of less than 50 meters; this behavior is characteristic of a vessel at anchor or moored, where heading is maintained by design but COG reflects drift around a fixed point, modeled approximately as a small circular or elliptical loiter pattern centered at (54.3662, 10.1420))",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel's speed over ground (sog) is consistently 0.0–0.5 knots, indicating minimal movement)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (the course over ground (cog) varies widely from 36.3° to 320.3°, showing frequent and erratic changes in direction despite no movement)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (the heading remains fixed at 283.0° throughout, indicating the vessel’s bow is not turning, even as COG fluctuates)",
