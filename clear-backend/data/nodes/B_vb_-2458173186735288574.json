    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a near-zero speed across consecutive AIS reports, indicating it is stationary or drifting slightly)",
    "Course change: stable (COG remains constant at approximately 295.5° despite minor position fluctuations, suggesting no active course change)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading varies only slightly between 281.0° and 284.0°, consistent with a moored or anchored vessel adjusting to wind or current)",
