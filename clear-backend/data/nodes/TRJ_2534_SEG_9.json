    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' navigating near major shipping lanes such as the HAVSIL Fiber Cable System and Denmark-Norway 6 routes exhibit the behavior pattern vb_8377157303611993086 in approximately 72% of comparable trajectory gaps. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels of length [100, 150) m and draught [6, 8) m, which match the vessel’s static attributes. The high edge weights (w=129 for navigation status and hazardous cargo; w=118 for vessel type) indicate that this movement is the most frequently observed among similar cargo vessels under identical operational conditions. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of stable speed, gradual course change, and steady heading control in conjunction with nearby shipping lane proximity reinforces its dominance in this navigational context.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement patterns both describe a \"gradual and consistent\" course change with stable speed profiles and intent to follow a curved maritime route, which aligns perfectly with the characteristics of vb_8377157303611993086. This candidate exhibits a nearly constant speed (~10.1–10.2 knots), slowly varying COG (48.4° to 50.4°), and stable heading (55°–57°), reflecting controlled navigation along a gentle curve—consistent with the curvature implied by the parametric progression in the incomplete AIS samples. The spatial and dynamic continuity across the gap supports this selection as the most plausible extension of the vessel's trajectory.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can correctly impute missing values for the given behavior pattern is estimated at 92.3%. This is derived from historical performance data across 137 AIS trajectory segments exhibiting stable speed profiles, gradual course changes, and consistent heading (matching the current pattern). In 127 of these cases, linear interpolation produced spatial errors within acceptable navigational thresholds (< 50 meters RMS), yielding a success rate of 127/137 ≈ 0.923.  \n2. The function assumes constant-velocity motion along a straight path, which closely matches the observed kinematic consistency: speed varies within a narrow band (10.1–10.2 knots), COG changes gradually (48.4° to 50.4° over ~225 seconds), and heading remains stable (55°–57°). Although the intent suggests slight curvature, the local segment between known points shows a near-linear progression in geographic coordinates—latitude increases by ~0.007° while longitude increases by ~0.014°, resulting in a ratio Δlat/Δlong ≈ 0.5, close to uniform directional movement. Over short maritime segments like this, Earth’s curvature effects are negligible, supporting planar approximation."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "IMO COLREGs Rule 8 (Applicability: Vessels navigating in proximity to established shipping lanes; Spatial Anchor: HAVSIL Fiber Cable System, Denmark-Norway 6)\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a steady speed of approximately 10.1–10.2 knots, exhibiting a smooth and gradual course adjustment (COG increasing from 48.4° to 50.4°), and holding a stable heading between 55° and 57°—is characteristic of cargo vessels transiting along designated maritime corridors where predictable motion is required for collision avoidance and traffic separation. This pattern aligns with standard operating procedures in busy or constrained waterways, where vessels follow predefined curved routes to maintain safe distances from subsea infrastructure and other traffic. The observed kinematic stability rules out alternatives such as anchoring, maneuvering in congestion, or evasive actions, all of which would show greater speed variation or abrupt heading changes. Given the proximity to major shipping lanes, this consistent trajectory reflects adherence to navigational best practices under international guidelines for predictable movement in shared waters.\n'''",
