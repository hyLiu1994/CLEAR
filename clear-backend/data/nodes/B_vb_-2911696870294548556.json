  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory moving west-southwest, approximated by the parametric equations: lat(t) ≈ 55.9762 - 0.0071 × t, lon(t) ≈ 16.2013 - 0.0398 × t, where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of approximately 11.0–11.1 knots across all observations)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 237.0° and 238.0°, indicating a very smooth and steady course evolution without abrupt changes)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains fixed at 234.0° throughout the sequence, showing no oscillation or yawing)",
