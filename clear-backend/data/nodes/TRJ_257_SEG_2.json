    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, tanker vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo are strongly associated with curved maritime route behaviors when navigating near shipping lanes, as evidenced by the high edge weights from navigation status (w=113) and absence of hazardous cargo (w=113), which together account for approximately 72% of the strongest behavioral associations in the graph. The vessel’s draught [4,6) m and dimensions [50–100 m length, 10–15 m width] further reinforce this pattern, aligning closely with typical coastal maneuvering profiles observed in similar tankers. Among all candidate patterns, this behavior shows the highest co-occurrence frequency with the given static attributes, particularly under the \"Under way using engine\" status, and is more prevalent than alternatives by a margin of at least 15 percentage points in normalized weight comparison.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern describes a stable speed (~9.3 knots), gradual and consistent course change (COG evolving from 174.1° to 176.0°), and minimal heading fluctuation—indicative of controlled navigation along a gently curved route. This closely matches the intent and dynamics of vb_-24485554849544898, which also exhibits stable speed (7.7–10.1 knots), a smooth right turn (COG increasing from 36.3° to 51.4°), and tight heading-COG alignment. Although absolute headings differ, the kinematic signature—stable propulsion, small but continuous course evolution, and constrained heading variation—is structurally consistent with the gap’s entry and exit conditions. Furthermore, both the boundary segment and the selected pattern model curvature via polynomial or parametric spatial progression, supporting continuity in trajectory shape across the missing block.\n'''"

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Undetermined\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel is operating under standard navigation conditions with no hazardous cargo, moving steadily along a gently curving maritime route. Its consistent speed, minimal heading variation, and gradual course change indicate controlled autopilot-assisted navigation typical of tankers maneuvering in designated waterways near shipping lanes. This behavior aligns with routine coastal transit protocols where vessels follow predefined curved paths to maintain safe separation and navigational predictability. The observed kinematic pattern—stable propulsion, smooth turning, and tight alignment between heading and course—rules out anchoring, erratic maneuvering, or abrupt course adjustments, which would suggest different operational states such as docking, evasive action, or port operations.\n'''",
