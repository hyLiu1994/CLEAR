    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed of approximately 15.0–15.1 knots across all observations)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 215.4° and 216.8°, indicating a smooth, controlled progression without abrupt turns)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains nearly constant at 216° or 217°, with minimal deviation of ±0.5°, suggesting precise directional control)",
