  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 9.8 and 10.3 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 354.7° and 2.0°, indicating a smooth, near-northward progression with minor course adjustments)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within 2.0°–4.0°, showing no abrupt rudder movements or yaw instability)",
