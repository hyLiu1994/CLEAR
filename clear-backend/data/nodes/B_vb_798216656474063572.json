  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial: latitude ≈ 54.196 + 0.005t + 0.0003t², longitude ≈ 9.546 + 0.012t + 0.0007t², where t is normalized time index)",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 6.7 and 7.0 knots throughout the trajectory)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG decreases slowly and consistently from 57.5° to 49.8°, indicating a smooth, continuous turn to the right)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 49.0° to 55.0°, with stepwise changes of 1°–2°, suggesting controlled rudder adjustments)",
