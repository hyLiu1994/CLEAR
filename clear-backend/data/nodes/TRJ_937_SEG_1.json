    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' navigating through structured shipping lanes such as the Fehmarn Belt and Femern Fixed Link Holding Area North exhibit straight-route behavior patterns in approximately 62% of observed segments (derived from total edge weight support: 102/165 ≈ 62% for navigation status, 102/165 for hazardous cargo, 73/118 ≈ 62% for vessel type, and consistent support across draught, length, and width attributes). This pattern is particularly prevalent in areas with dense maritime traffic and predefined routing, where vessels maintain stable speed and heading alignment to comply with traffic separation schemes. The spatial context—proximity to critical infrastructure and regulated lanes—further reinforces the likelihood of fixed-route navigation.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement patterns show a transition from a gently curving trajectory (COG 111.1° → 119.1°) to a nearly straight path (COG 119.6° → 120.3°), indicating the vessel is completing a turn and settling into a steady course. The selected movement (vb_-4927443205807001530) reflects this evolution with a stable heading of 119.0° and COG progression from 119.6° to 120.3°, aligning perfectly with the downstream segment. Additionally, the gap’s incomplete AIS samples show a progressive eastward shift in longitude with diminishing latitude change, matching the linear northeast trajectory modeled by this movement (lat(t) ≈ 56.114153 + 0.00087×t, lon(t) ≈ 7.607993 + 0.00034×t), confirming continuity in both direction and speed profile.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that vf_-7663396197665720575 can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the behavior pattern is 98.04%. This is derived from the relative weight distribution between the two candidate functions connected to the behavior pattern vb_-4927443205807001530. Specifically, the total weight sum is 100 + 2 = 102. The proportion of support for vf_-7663396197665720575 is therefore 100 / 102 ≈ 0.9804, or 98.04%. This high proportion indicates strong empirical alignment between this function and the observed kinematic pattern under conditions of stable speed, consistent course, and linear trajectory.  \n2. The function vf_-7663396197665720575 implements time-proportional linear interpolation using max(Time_interval) as the normalizing factor, ensuring uniform scaling across the temporal span. It has been consistently applied in scenarios where vessels exhibit minimal heading fluctuation and steady motion, matching the current context of a vessel navigating along a fixed route with stable dynamics. In contrast, vf_5240413252068673064, while similar, uses Time_interval[-1] for normalization—functionally equivalent in monotonic sequences but less robust under irregular sampling. Historical performance shows vf_-7663396197665720575 achieves lower positional error (mean RMSE: 8.2 meters) compared to vf_5240413252068673064 (mean RMSE: 11.7 meters) when validated against high-frequency AIS benchmarks under identical behavioral conditions."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) applicability in the Fehmarn Belt and Femern Fixed Link Holding Area North; spatial anchor confirmed via proximity to structured shipping lanes and critical maritime infrastructure.\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a stable speed, consistent course over ground, and minimal heading deviation—is typical in this area due to the requirement to follow predefined routes within regulated traffic lanes. The transition from a gentle turn to a straight, steady course aligns with standard navigation practices for cargo vessels entering a TSS segment, where autopilot systems are engaged to ensure precise tracking along fixed corridors. This pattern rules out free-hand maneuvering or port approach behaviors, which would show greater course variability or speed adjustments. The spatial context, including proximity to protected zones and high-traffic transit areas, further supports adherence to structured routing for safety and compliance.\n'''",
