  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial:",

    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 12.5 and 13.7 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies narrowly between 206.5° and 209.0°, showing a slow, sustained progression in course direction)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains consistently at 208° or 209°, indicating no abrupt rudder movements)",
