    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 15.8 and 16.1 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slightly between 215.8° and 217.1°, showing a smooth progression without abrupt changes)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within 215.0°–216.0°, indicating controlled steering with minor adjustments)",
