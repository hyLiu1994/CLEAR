  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the vessel is navigating along a geographically constrained path, likely a designated shipping lane or coastal route with a gentle curvature; the simultaneous southward and eastward progression with gradual COG shift suggests movement along a known arc-shaped trajectory approximated by a second-order polynomial in latitude-longitude space: Δlat ≈ a·Δlon² + b·Δlon + c)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 7.9 and 8.5 knots with minimal variation)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly from ~214° to ~207°, then back to ~216°, indicating a smooth, controlled adjustment in direction over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 212°–215°, with only minor adjustments, suggesting steady helm control)",
