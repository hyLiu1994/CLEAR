    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and operating in Danish waters near unnamed traffic separation schemes most frequently exhibit straight-line navigation behavior when transiting open coastal routes. This pattern is especially prevalent among vessels of length [100, 150) m and draught [8, 10) m, which are commonly engaged in regional maritime transport. The behavior pattern vb_-4927443205807001530 is strongly supported by the graph, receiving cumulative edge weights of 102 (navigation status), 102 (hazardous cargo), 73 (vessel type), 39 (draught), 25 (length), and 33 (width), amounting to a total weight of 374—second highest among all candidates. When normalized across vessel-type-specific patterns, this movement accounts for approximately 62% of observed behaviors for similar cargo vessels under identical operational status and spatial context.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern describes a vessel navigating along a fixed route with stable speed, gradual and consistent course change, and stable heading fluctuation—indicative of linear trajectory following. The selected movement vb_-4927443205807001530 matches this intent precisely, modeling a northeast-bound linear progression (lat(t) ≈ 56.114153 + 0.00087 × t, lon(t) ≈ 7.607993 + 0.00034 × t), which aligns with the continuity of motion expected across the gap. Furthermore, the incomplete AIS samples show a steady west-southwest progression that extrapolates smoothly into this northeastern trajectory given local hydrographic layout, supporting a coherent transition through constrained maritime corridors. The duration range (200~250) also overlaps sufficiently with the adjacent segment’s 250~300 window, ensuring temporal plausibility.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that vf_-7663396197665720575 can correctly impute missing latitude and longitude values under the given behavior pattern is 98.04%. This is derived from the relative weight distribution in the association structure, where the total observed weight for this behavior-function pair is 100 (favoring vf_-7663396197665720575) and 2 (favoring vf_5240413252068673064), resulting in a normalized likelihood of 100 / (100 + 2) = 0.9804 or 98.04%. This indicates strong empirical alignment between the function and the kinematic pattern of steady, linear navigation.  \n2. The function vf_-7663396197665720575 explicitly models temporal progression using max(Time_interval) as the normalizing factor, ensuring proportionality across the full time span. In contrast, vf_5240413252068673064 uses Time_interval[-1], which assumes sorted input but does not clarify handling of non-uniform intervals. Given that real AIS data may have irregular timestamps due to transmission delays or sensor sampling variance, the use of max(Time_interval) provides more robust scaling, increasing reliability under variable temporal resolution."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme Applicability — Applies in Danish waters near designated shipping lanes; vessels are expected to follow prescribed routes to avoid collisions.\nOperational Protocol Rationale: In this region, cargo vessels without hazardous materials typically maintain steady speed and direction along predefined linear paths, especially when transiting between coastal waypoints within structured traffic zones. The observed stable speed, consistent course over ground, and minimal heading variation reflect autopilot-assisted navigation aligned with maritime routing protocols. This behavior is characteristic of open-water segments where vessels optimize for fuel efficiency and collision avoidance by minimizing maneuvering. Alternative behaviors such as curvilinear motion or frequent course adjustments are less likely here, as they would suggest approach to port, anchorage, or complex waterways—none of which are present in this context. The linear trajectory moving northeast aligns with the expected flow of traffic through a regulated corridor, ensuring safe separation from opposing streams.\n'''",
