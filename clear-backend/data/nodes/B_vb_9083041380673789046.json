    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a low but consistent speed between 0.1 and 0.7 knots, indicating controlled movement rather than drifting or anchoring)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG evolves smoothly from ~180° to ~240° over time, showing a continuous turn to the south-southeast)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 207°–219°, suggesting minimal rudder activity and stable orientation control)",
