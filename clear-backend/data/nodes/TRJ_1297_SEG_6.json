    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' with no hazardous cargo and dimensions typical of medium-sized freighters (150–200 m length, 25–30 m width) navigating near shipping lanes exhibit the \"navigating along a fixed route\" behavior in approximately 62% of observed segments, based on the strongest co-occurrence weight for this pattern among all candidates. This movement is particularly prevalent when vessels maintain stable speed and heading alignment, as seen in 62 out of every 102 comparable vessel-state transitions. The static attributes—especially vessel type (Cargo), navigation status, and spatial proximity to structured routes—consistently correlate with linear, predictable trajectories, reinforcing that such vessels tend to follow predefined corridors with minimal course deviation.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern explicitly describes a vessel \"navigating along a fixed route\" with stable speed, gradual and consistent course change, and stable heading fluctuation, moving westward with a slight northerly drift. The candidate movement vb_3366872286460794881 matches this intent precisely, exhibiting nearly constant speed (~15.2–15.3 knots), minimal COG variation (274.1° to 274.8°), and perfectly stable heading (273.0°), indicating precise rudder control and straight-line motion. Furthermore, its parametric trajectory model shows uniform westward progression with slight northerly component, aligning directly with the boundary segment’s directional trend. Unlike curved-route patterns, this linear fixed-route behavior best explains the continuity of motion across the gap.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that function `vf_5240413252068673064` correctly addresses the missing value problem is 98.4%, calculated as 61 / (61 + 1) = 61 / 62 ≈ 0.9839. This indicates that, among the two candidate functions evaluated under statistically comparable conditions for this specific behavior pattern, `vf_5240413252068673064` was associated with successful imputation outcomes in approximately 98.4% of relevant historical cases. In contrast, `vf_-7663396197665720575` accounted for only about 1.6% of effective resolutions, suggesting significantly lower empirical reliability for this motion type.  \n2. Function `vf_5240413252068673064` implements time-proportional linear interpolation using normalized time intervals (`t / Time_interval[-1]`), which ensures precise alignment with observed temporal progression and constant-velocity dynamics. Its formulation directly incorporates the full duration scale via `Time_interval[-1]`, enhancing numerical stability and positional accuracy over extended gaps. Given the vessel’s stable speed (15.2–15.3 knots), consistent COG (274.1°–274.8°), and fixed heading (273.0°), the assumption of uniform rectilinear motion is strongly justified, making this function highly compatible with the kinematic context."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Undetermined\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a nearly constant speed of approximately 15.2–15.3 knots, exhibiting minimal change in course over ground (ranging only from 274.1° to 274.8°), and holding a fixed heading of 273.0° throughout the observed period—strongly indicates that it is following a straight, predefined maritime route. This pattern is typical for cargo vessels operating under autopilot in structured seaways, where predictable, linear motion ensures safe separation from other traffic and adherence to established traffic lanes. The slight westward trajectory with a minor northerly component aligns with efficient transit through organized shipping zones. Unlike patterns involving curved routing or variable speed profiles, this consistent, stable movement reflects disciplined navigation practices commonly used in open but regulated waters. Given the vessel’s static characteristics—medium-sized cargo carrier, no hazardous cargo, actively propelled—the observed behavior matches standard operational expectations for vessels transiting along fixed corridors. The spatial context suggests proximity to designated shipping lanes, further supporting the use of such predictable routing despite incomplete query data.\n'''",
