  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the persistent small differences between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and gradual course evolution, suggest the vessel is navigating a predefined curved channel or coastal bend; position progression follows an approximately linear trajectory in geographic coordinates with slight northeasterly curvature, modeled by a second-order polynomial: lat ≈ 54.2576 + 0.0001*(t), lon ≈ 9.6219 + 0.00005*(t) + 0.000001*(t²), where t is sequential observation index)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 6.6 and 7.0 knots across the trajectory, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG increases slowly from 16.8° to 35.3° over time, showing a smooth, continuous turn to starboard)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading varies only slightly between 16.0° and 38.0°, remaining closely aligned with COG, suggesting controlled steering without oscillation)",
