  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation: lat(t) ≈ 54.3534 + 0.0092 × t - 0.0008 × t², lon(t) ≈ 9.8908 - 0.0921 × t + 0.0075 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 6.4 and 7.1 knots across the trajectory segment)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly from ~299° to ~255°, then further decreases to ~228°, indicating a smooth, continuous turn over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 228°–300°, with minimal short-term variation, suggesting controlled steering)",
    "Behavior intent: following a curved maritime route (the combination of stable speed, small heading variations, and slowly changing COG indicates the vessel is navigating along a gently curving channel or coastal path; the trajectory approximates a circular arc with radius ~2.5 km, modeled by a parametric equation: lat(t) ≈ 54.3534 + 0.0092 × t - 0.0008 × t², lon(t) ≈ 9.8908 - 0.0921 × t + 0.0075 × t², where t is normalized time index from 0 to 1 over the observed segment)",
