  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route (the vessel progresses northeastward along a gently curving path, likely aligned with a designated traffic lane or coastal navigation route; the trajectory can be approximated by a circular arc: $ \\text{lat} = a + R \\cos(\\theta), \\text{lon} = b + R \\sin(\\theta) $, where $ R $ is radius of curvature derived from average turn rate and SOG)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 7.0 and 9.9 knots with minor fluctuations, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (the COG varies slowly between 22.7° and 32.9°, showing a smooth directional transition over time)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (the heading remains within a narrow range of 35°–38°, suggesting minimal rudder activity and stable steering)",
