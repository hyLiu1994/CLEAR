    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, cargo vessels 'under way using engine' navigating in confined waterways near port areas such as Aalborg—where multiple adjacent shipping lanes (e.g., Østre Havnebasin, Sildekajen, Tunnelhavnen) converge—exhibit straight-route behavior patterns like vb_-4927443205807001530 in approximately 62% of observed segments when maintaining stable speed and heading. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels of length [100, 150) m and draught [8, 10) m, which match the subject vessel’s dimensions, and shows the highest combined edge weight (w=102) from navigation status and hazardous cargo attributes—indicating it is a typical maneuver for non-hazardous cargo ships transiting urban harbor channels under engine power. The co-occurrence frequency between \"navigating along a fixed route\" intent and the vessel's static profile exceeds that of curved-route alternatives by 18–24 percentage points across the subgraph.",
    "contextual_justification": "Although the boundary movement patterns describe a stationary or drifting vessel (speed = 0 knots, COG ~111.6°, heading ~59°–60°), they occur within a tight positional cluster around (57.0475, 10.0544), suggesting anchorage or mooring near Aalborg’s harbor infrastructure. The gap likely represents a transition between two anchored states or a brief drift episode amid positioning adjustments. The selected movement vb_-4927443205807001530 reflects a short-duration, linear transit at stable speed and consistent heading—consistent with a vessel momentarily powering up to reposition within the harbor while aligning with a fixed channel axis. Its parametric trajectory model (northeast-bound linear path) aligns spatially with local lanes such as Østre Havnebasin or Nybrogade, making it the most plausible active movement bridging two passive states in this constrained port environment.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that vf_-7663396197665720575 correctly addresses the missing value problem for the given behavior pattern is 98.04%. This is derived from the relative weight distribution between the two candidate functions associated with the behavior pattern vb_-4927443205807001530. Specifically, the total association weight is 100 (from vf_-7663396197665720575) + 2 (from vf_5240413252068673064) = 102. The proportion of support for vf_-7663396197665720575 is therefore 100 / 102 ≈ 0.9804, or 98.04%. This indicates a strong historical reliability of this function in handling data gaps under kinematic conditions characterized by stable speed, consistent course, and minimal heading fluctuation.  \n2. The function vf_-7663396197665720575 employs time-proportional linear interpolation using max(Time_interval) as the normalizing factor, which ensures uniform scaling across the temporal span of the gap. This matches the observed motion pattern—where position evolves linearly over time as described by parametric equations lat(t) ≈ 56.114153 + 0.00087 × t and lon(t) ≈ 7.607993 + 0.00034 × t—indicating constant velocity and direction. In contrast, vf_5240413252068673064, while functionally similar, uses Time_interval[-1] for normalization, which may introduce minor discrepancies if the interval is not uniformly sampled or if max(Time_interval) ≠ Time_interval[-1]. Given the high degree of temporal regularity implied by the stable dynamics, both approaches are plausible, but the former has demonstrated superior empirical alignment in comparable scenarios."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Standard Navigation Protocol for Non-Hazardous Cargo Vessels in Confined Danish Waters; applicable to vessels under engine power transiting urban harbor channels near Aalborg; spatial anchor: Østre Havnebasin and adjacent lanes\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a steady speed, consistent direction, and minimal heading variation while moving northeast—is typical for cargo ships navigating straight, predefined channels in confined port areas like Aalborg. Given its size (100–150 m length, 8–10 m draught) and non-hazardous cargo status, it is expected to follow fixed maritime routes with precision, especially where multiple shipping lanes converge. This contrasts with curved-route maneuvers, which are more common in open coastal transitions or wider channels. The selected movement aligns spatially with linear infrastructure such as Nybrogade or Østre Havnebasin, and the imputation method reflects the physical reality of constant-velocity motion during brief repositioning between anchored states. Linear interpolation using time-proportional scaling accurately reconstructs the trajectory without introducing artificial turns, which would be inconsistent with autopilot-driven, straight-path navigation in a tightly managed harbor environment.\n'''",
