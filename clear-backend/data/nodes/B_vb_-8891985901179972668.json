  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: following a curved maritime route forms a small elliptical pattern, approximated by a parametric equation of a circle with radius ~20 meters: lat(t) ≈ 55.71205 + 0.00005 × sin(2πt), lon(t) ≈ 10.97055 + 0.00007 × cos(2πt), where t ∈ [0,1] represents normalized time over the loop; this reflects the vessel turning in place or adjusting position within a confined harbor area, likely during docking preparation or anchoring (the persistent low SOG, stable heading, and oscillating COG indicate the vessel is pivoting around a fixed point while maintaining orientation, typical of station-keeping maneuvers near a berth)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed of 0.1–0.2 knots, indicating minimal propulsion changes)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (the COG varies significantly from 107° to 208° and back down to 143°, showing repeated shifts in direction despite low speed)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (the heading remains tightly constrained between 264° and 274°, changing only gradually by 10° over the sequence)",
