  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed, with SOG varying only slightly around 6.8–6.9 knots in the first segment and 11.7–11.9 knots in the second)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG changes slowly and uniformly: from ~187° to ~189° in the first segment, then from ~100.3° to ~99.0° in the second, indicating smooth course evolution)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range—188°–193° in the first segment, 100°–101° in the second—showing minimal oscillation)",
    "Behavior intent: navigating along a fixed route (the persistent alignment between COG and heading, combined with stable speed and negligible course deviation, indicates the vessel is following a straight, predefined maritime route; the position progression follows a linear trajectory",
