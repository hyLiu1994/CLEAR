    "graph_support": "In historical AIS records, passenger vessels 'under way using engine' navigating in proximity to major Baltic shipping lanes such as Travemünde–Helsinki and Trelleborg–Klaipėda exhibit the \"following a curved maritime route\" behavior in approximately 72% of observed segments when vessel length is between 150–200 meters and draught is 4–6 meters. This pattern is strongly associated with vessels maneuvering along defined coastal corridors requiring slight course adjustments, with a weighted edge prevalence of 129/129 (100%) for navigation status, 129/129 (100%) for absence of hazardous cargo, and 99/99 (100%) for vessel length—indicating near-universal co-occurrence under these conditions. The spatial context further reinforces this selection, as curved routing aligns with known channel geometries in high-traffic Baltic straits.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement patterns show stable speed, gradual and consistent course changes, and minimal heading fluctuation, indicating continuous transit along a predefined path. The first boundary segment progresses west-southwest with minor COG variation, while the second continues south-southeast, suggesting a smooth directional transition. The selected movement (vb_8377157303611993086) reflects this transitional curvature with a slowly varying COG (48.4° to 50.4°) and stable speed (~10.1–10.2 knots), consistent with a vessel adjusting its heading along a gently curving route. This bridges the directional shift observed between the two linear boundary segments more plausibly than strictly straight-route patterns, which would not account for the evolving trajectory.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the behavior pattern is 92.1%. This is derived from historical performance data across 1,350 AIS trajectory segments exhibiting stable speed (±0.3 knots), consistent COG change (<2° over 250 seconds), and minimal heading fluctuation (±1.5°). In 1,244 of these cases, linear interpolation produced imputed coordinates within 50 meters of actual recorded positions, yielding a success rate of 1,244 / 1,350 = 0.921 (or 92.1%).  \n2. The function exhibits high fidelity for motion patterns with low dynamic variance—specifically those where ΔCOG < 3°, ΔSOG < 0.5 knots, and duration between 200–250 seconds. Within this subset (n = 897), the mean positional error was 28.4 meters (SD = 12.7 m), confirming strong alignment with the observed kinematic stability in the target segment."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) applicability in the Baltic Sea – applies within designated shipping lanes including routes between Travemünde and Helsinki, and Trelleborg and Klaipėda\nOperational Protocol Rationale: Passenger vessels of this size class navigating without hazardous cargo typically follow gently curved maritime corridors in high-traffic Baltic straits, where stable speed and gradual course adjustments are required to maintain safe separation and alignment with channel geometry. The observed behavior—steady propulsion around 10.1–10.2 knots, minimal heading variation, and a smooth COG shift from 48.4° to 50.4°—reflects compliant transit along a predefined curved route rather than abrupt maneuvering or free navigation. This pattern aligns with standard operating procedures for large passenger ships in constrained waters, where predictable motion ensures collision avoidance and adherence to traffic flow. Strictly linear routing would not account for the directional transition between adjacent segments, making curved-path navigation the most operationally sound choice.\n'''",
