    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a consistent speed between 8.5 and 10.4 knots with minor fluctuations)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slowly between 25.6° and 31.1°, indicating a smooth, continuous turn or route curvature)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 35°–38°, suggesting controlled navigation without abrupt changes)",
