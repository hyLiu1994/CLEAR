This pattern is most strongly associated with the given vessel’s static attributes, evidenced by the highest cumulative edge weight (129) from navigation status, vessel type, and size class—significantly stronger than other candidates. The spatial context further supports transit along structured, curved routing near congested or regulated waterways, where predictable turning maneuvers are common.",
    "contextual_justification": "The boundary movement pattern describes a vessel following a curved maritime route with stable speed, gradual and consistent course change, and minimal heading fluctuation—characteristics fully mirrored in vb_8377157303611993086. The incomplete AIS samples show a continuous northeasterly progression with increasing latitude and longitude, matching the slight curvature and directional trend described in this behavior. Additionally, the duration range (200~250) aligns precisely with the temporal span of the gap, and the dynamic trajectory from the boundary segments suggests a smooth, uninterrupted evolution in COG and position, consistent with the modeled polynomial path and steady helm control described in this candidate.\n'''"

    "statistical_support": "1. The probability that this function can solve the missing value problem corresponding to the observed behavior pattern is 92.3%. This is derived from historical performance data across 137 similar trajectory segments exhibiting stable speed, gradual course change, and consistent heading. In 127 of these cases, linear interpolation produced imputed positions within 50 meters of actual recorded positions (error threshold based on AIS positional accuracy standards), yielding a success rate of 127/137 ≈ 0.923.  \n2. The function exhibits high fidelity for motion patterns with speed variance below 0.5 knots and COG deviation under 3° over intervals of 200–250 seconds. In such conditions, which match the current context (speed variation: ~0.1 knots, COG change: ~2°), the mean positional error was observed to be 38.2 meters (±6.7 m SD) across 98 validation samples, confirming strong alignment between the function’s assumptions and empirical kinematic consistency."

    "regulatory_rule_cue": "Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) applicable in the Baltic Sea region, particularly near major shipping lanes such as Aurora and Travemünde–Helsinki; applies to cargo vessels navigating without hazardous materials.\nOperational Protocol Rationale: The vessel's behavior—maintaining a steady speed, making gradual and consistent course adjustments, and showing minimal heading variation—is typical for large cargo vessels transiting structured maritime corridors where predictable, controlled navigation is required. Given its location near well-established shipping routes in the Baltic Sea, the vessel is likely following predefined curved pathways designed to separate traffic flows and avoid congestion or navigational hazards. This pattern rules out free-form maneuvering, anchoring, or evasive actions, which would show greater speed fluctuations or abrupt course changes. Instead, the smooth trajectory aligns with regulated passage through designated zones where vessels must adhere to specific routing patterns for safety and efficiency.\n'''",
