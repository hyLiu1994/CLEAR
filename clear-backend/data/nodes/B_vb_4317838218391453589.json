    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a nearly constant speed between 9.9 and 10.1 knots, indicating steady propulsion)",
    "Course change: gradual and consistent (COG varies slowly from 49.5° to 48.6° over time, suggesting a smooth, intentional turn or route curvature)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (heading remains within a narrow range of 55°–57°, showing minimal rudder adjustments and good directional control)",
