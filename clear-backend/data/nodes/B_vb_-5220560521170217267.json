  "summary": "Vessel behavior pattern: anchored or moored in a confined area (the repeated position fixes at nearly identical latitude and longitude, combined with zero or near-zero SOG, indicate the vessel is not under way; the varying COG likely reflects sensor noise or minor swinging due to wind/tide while moored, typical of vessels at anchor in a harbor or berth)",
  "description": [
    "Speed profile: stable (the vessel maintains a near-zero speed across multiple observations, indicating no significant movement)",
    "Course change: fluctuating (the COG values vary widely between 77.0° and 350.2°, showing inconsistent directional intent despite lack of motion)",
    "Heading fluctuation: stable (the heading remains within a narrow range of 222.0° to 243.0°, suggesting the vessel is oriented in a fixed direction while stationary)",
    "Behavior intent: anchored or moored in a confined area (the repeated position fixes at nearly identical latitude and longitude, combined with zero or near-zero SOG, indicate the vessel is not under way; the varying COG likely reflects sensor noise or minor swinging due to wind/tide while moored, typical of vessels at anchor in a harbor or berth)",
